            "summary": "\nUK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves announced a new budget that includes more taxes for ordinary workers but higher government spending on social welfare programmes.  The new plan will raise the government's tax take to a post-war high of 38% of GDP by 2031, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).  It will give the government greater room to meet its deficit-reduction targets - prompting investors to buy long-dated government bonds, sending yields sharply lower. \n",

As organised groups like Boko Haram fade, new threats emerge: decentralised bandits driven by poverty, climate stress, and lack of opportunity. Dr. Yates warns that without long-term development and regional integration, policing alone will never solve the crisis.\n",

The claims, made by her sister in an affidavit, accuse her and two others of luring 17 South Africans to Russia under false pretences and sending them to the Donbas war zone without their consent. The case has been handed to a special police unit, and the presidency has said it was asked to help rescue the 17 men allegedly trapped in the region. FRANCE 24's correspondent Eunice Masson has more from Cape Town.\n",

            "summary": "\nThe Digital Era has devolved into a veritable Information Crisis. As we become overwhelmed by misinformation and facts void of any context or perspective, fear, anger and nativism rise to the surface. For in-depth analysis and a deeper perspective of a world marked by conflict and angry populism, Eve Irvine is pleased to welcome Naomi Alderman, award-winning author, radio producer, Professor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University and Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Her new book: “Don’t Burn Anyone at the Stake Today (and Other Lessons from History About Living Through an Information Crisis)” offers much-needed historical context in an era where history, technology, and human nature collide: This isn’t the first time we’re facing an information crisis, explains Ms Alderman. Centuries ago, the invention of the printing press ripped through the fabric of society. Suddenly, ideas and knowledge spread like wildfire. It was as liberating as it was devastating. The printing press did pave the way for the Enlightenment... following a century of immense brutality during the Reformation. Whether it’s the 16th century or the 21st century, we can see very real parallels: “When technologies of information dispersal increase quite suddenly, within a generation, you often get profound social unrest.” From the printing press to the Digital Age, we begin to understand to what extent human nature remains chillingly unchanged.\n",

Nigel Farage and his right-wing populist party, Reform UK, are soaring in the polls. For years, Farage has argued that immigration is the cause of Britain's problems, from the rising cost of living to long hospital waiting lists. FRANCE 24's Clovis Casali and Claire Paccalin travelled around the UK to find out what impact this message is having on British people. \n",

The White House has not contested the veracity of the transcript. In November, an initial draft of a peace plan proposed by the US listed measures that would push Ukraine to give up territory and reduce its military in return for peace. The Kremlin said the leak of the transcript was an attempt to hinder peace talks for Ukraine.\n",
