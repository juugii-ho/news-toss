Four years ago, a single bird could be heard at this secluded spot in rural Surrey; this summer, they were everywhere. \u201cWe were hearing them calling all night, from five different territories,\u201d says Meg Cookson, lead ecologist for the <a href=\"https://www.youngwilders.org/\">Youngwilders</a>, pointing to the woodland around us. A group of Youngwilders were camping out at the site, but the birds were so loud, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t sleep all night,\u201d says Layla Mapemba, the group\u2019s engagement lead. \u201cWe were all knackered the next day, but it was so cool.\u201d An expert from the Surrey Wildlife Trust came to help them net and ring one of the nightingales the next morning, Cookson recalls: \u201cHe\u2019d never held a nightingale in his hands before. He was crying.\u201d</p><p>Rewilding is by definition a slow business, but here at Maple Farm, after just four years, the results are already visible, and audible.

Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes\u2019s planned biopics create new arguments?</p><p>The early notion of the Beatles as \u201cfour lads that shook the world\u201d has been subject to many shifts in emphasis over the decades. They have been valorised, vilified, mythologised, misunderstood and even ignored. The release this month of the new Beatles Anthology \u2013 an expansion of the original mid-1990s compilation with CD, vinyl reissues and the documentary series streaming on Disney+ \u2013 is testament not just to their enduring appeal but also to how the constant reframing of their story reveals as much about our changing tastes. The 2025 edition arrives as a full-scale revisitation of the original project, bringing with it a remastered, expanded documentary series and a substantial reissue campaign.</p><p>What is more likely to reshape the way we see the band, though, is the addition of a brand-new ninth episode to the original TV series, built from recently excavated footage of Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr working together in 1994\u201395. Far more intimate and informal than the original broadcast, this material captures the three surviving Beatles rehearsing, reflecting and simply spending time as old friends rather than cultural monuments, albeit still with the \u201ckid brother\u201d tensions between Harrison and McCartney. They work on Free As a Bird and Now and Then, jokingly speculate on a stadium reunion tour and generally talk about their history, loss and their unfinished musical ideas. It\u2019s a rare, humanising coda to the well-worn story. With new material like this, and with more than that axiomatic 50 years of distance since the Beatles dissolved in a blizzard of lawsuits and \u201cfunny paper\u201d, are we finally approaching a unified theory of everything fab?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/25/the-beatles-anthology-stuart-maconie-historiography\">Continue reading...</a>",

And as in the summer, Mr Zelenskyy and blindsided European leaders strove to stay polite while scrambling to limit the damage.</p><p>The salvage operation appears to have been relatively successful, following Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/24/zelenskyy-trump-meeting-revised-us-peace-plan-ukraine-russia\">meeting</a> in Geneva between the US secretary of state, Marco&nbsp;Rubio, and a Ukrainian delegation. The 28-point plan reportedly drafted by Mr Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the Kremlin adviser, Kirill Dmitriev, was in effect a repackaging of Mr Putin\u2019s maximalist demands. A deal premised on the handing over of new territory in the Donbas region to Russia, restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and drastic limits on the size of its future army, could never be acceptable to Kyiv. Mr Rubio, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-team-hearing-us-both-us-and-ukraine-report-progress-after-geneva-talks/\">suggesting</a> a more \u201crefined\u201d framework was&nbsp;now being developed, seemed to at least acknowledge this&nbsp;fundamental difficulty.</p><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the multilateral system at Cop30 held together at a point when its collapse felt close. This ought to be a warning: next year\u2019s conference of the parties must strike a better bargain between the rich and poor world.</p><p>Developing countries are far from united on some issues.

Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance.

Perhaps surprisingly, humanity is (mostly) choosing to band together, according to most people I\u2019ve talked to about this game.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/\">review for Gamespot</a>, Mark Delaney paints a beguiling picture of Arc Raiders\u2019s potential for generating war stories, and highlights its surprisingly hopeful tone as the thing that elevates it above similar multiplayer extraction shooters: \u201cWe can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/19/pushing-buttons-arc-raiders-generative-ai-call-of-duty\">Continue reading...</a>",

But in Europe, where home computers ruled the era, the NES was beaten by a technologically superior rival.</p><p>The Sega Master System was originally released in Japan in the autumn of 1985 as the Sega Mark III. Based around the famed Z80 CPU (used in home computers such as the Spectrum, Amstrad and TRS-80) and a powerful Sega-designed video display processor, it boasted 8kb of RAM, a 64-colour palette and the ability to generate 32 sprites on screen at one time \u2013 making the NES (based on the older 6502 processor) look like an ancient relic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/nov/18/sega-master-system-nintendo-entertainment-system\">Continue reading...</a>",

This is The Sacrifice of Isaac and I am looking at it in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, feeling distressed by how Caravaggio has so chillingly rendered the face of this suffering child from the biblical tale. It looks as if Abraham, who has been told by God to kill his son, could break his neck with just one twist. Yet Abraham\u2019s preferred method is with the silvery grey knife he holds in his other hand, ready to slit Isaac\u2019s throat. One thing\u2019s for certain \u2013 whoever posed as Isaac for this astonishing work was a great actor. There is not just dread, shock and pleading in his darkened eyes but also grief that a guardian could betray him so utterly.</p><p>Standing in front of the painting, I know this is a real face, an accurate record of a young model, because the same boy \u2013 recognisable by his tousled hair and almost black eyes \u2013 appears in two other paintings by Caravaggio. In each, that richly expressive face steals the show. In John the Baptist, he looks mischievously out of the shadows while cuddling a ram.

(Or even a four-and-a-half-hour play with several intermissions.) Yet Initiative, a new off-Broadway coming-of-age epic of sorts, flies right by, as emotionally immersive as the Dungeons &amp; Dragons games that enrapture most of its seven teenage characters. Playwright Else Went doesn\u2019t seem worried about the show\u2019s length. \u201cIt was very much part of the intent,\u201d they said. (Went is non-binary and uses they/she pronouns.) \u201cWhen you sit in the theater for long enough \u2013 without feeling like the thing that you\u2019re watching is failing you \u2013 there\u2019s a certain point that you cross as an audience member, where you enter a new type of commitment. And it is in that state that new things can happen, dramatically.\u201d</p><p>Initiative certainly does new things with material that could have been familiar. It arrives, after a lengthy workshop period, at a time when Dungeons &amp; Dragons seems resurgent in visibility, thanks in part to the Netflix smash-hit Stranger Things, which uses D&amp;D players (and game-derived terminology) in its own \u201880s-set fantasy-adventure-horror story. (There\u2019s even a Stranger Things prequel play on Broadway.) Initiative defies some of the cultural cliches about the game, starting with its setting; rather than a self-consciously retro \u201880s, it takes place during the early years of the millennium, following its characters between 2000 and 2004. More subtly but equally bold, the show doesn\u2019t begin with a tight-knit nerd crew role-playing together before life pulls them in separate directions, a standard narrative for these types of stories. In fact, no one in the show plays the game until late in the first of three 90-minute acts, when Riley (Greg Cuellar) acts as Dungeon Master for his younger friends Em (Christopher Dylan White), Tony (Jamie Sanders), and Kendall (Andrea Lopez Alvarez). Eventually, they\u2019re joined by Riley\u2019s best friend Clara (Olivia Rose Barresi), who finds the game to be an unexpected escape from her self-applied academic pressure, romantic/sexual traumas, and the horrors of a post-9/11 United States.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/nov/25/dungeons-and-dragons-play-initiative\">Continue reading...</a>",
