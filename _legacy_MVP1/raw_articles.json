Will the returning Anthology project and Sam Mendes\u2019s planned biopics create new arguments?</p><p>The early notion of the Beatles as \u201cfour lads that shook the world\u201d has been subject to many shifts in emphasis over the decades. They have been valorised, vilified, mythologised, misunderstood and even ignored. The release this month of the new Beatles Anthology \u2013 an expansion of the original mid-1990s compilation with CD, vinyl reissues and the documentary series streaming on Disney+ \u2013 is testament not just to their enduring appeal but also to how the constant reframing of their story reveals as much about our changing tastes. The 2025 edition arrives as a full-scale revisitation of the original project, bringing with it a remastered, expanded documentary series and a substantial reissue campaign.</p><p>What is more likely to reshape the way we see the band, though, is the addition of a brand-new ninth episode to the original TV series, built from recently excavated footage of Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr working together in 1994\u201395. Far more intimate and informal than the original broadcast, this material captures the three surviving Beatles rehearsing, reflecting and simply spending time as old friends rather than cultural monuments, albeit still with the \u201ckid brother\u201d tensions between Harrison and McCartney. They work on Free As a Bird and Now and Then, jokingly speculate on a stadium reunion tour and generally talk about their history, loss and their unfinished musical ideas. It\u2019s a rare, humanising coda to the well-worn story. With new material like this, and with more than that axiomatic 50 years of distance since the Beatles dissolved in a blizzard of lawsuits and \u201cfunny paper\u201d, are we finally approaching a unified theory of everything fab?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/25/the-beatles-anthology-stuart-maconie-historiography\">Continue reading...</a>",

    "summary": "<p><strong>Tate Britain, London</strong> <br>JMW Turner is beaten by John Constable in this mighty show. But who cares when the work is so sublime you can hear the squelching and smell the river?</p><p>Turner or Constable: who\u2019s the boss? Tate Britain\u2019s exhibition of work by the two artists, subtitled Rivals and Originals, fudges the question. Born a year apart and both alumni of the Royal Academy schools in London, each was keenly aware of what the other was doing, in a British art world that was as febrile and competitive, if immeasurably smaller, than it is today (although you should try the Italian Renaissance if you want full-blooded rivalries and enmities). Sometimes, they sought the same collectors and painted the same subjects. Turner was encouraged from an early age by his father, a Covent Garden wigmaker and barber; Constable was the son of a Suffolk mill owner and grain merchant who wanted him to take over the family business.</p><p>As well as their contrasting backgrounds, their temperaments could not have been more different. A scene from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/02/mr-turner-review-mike-leigh-biopic-great-master\">Mike Leigh\u2019s 2014 film Mr Turner</a>, starring Timothy Spall as Turner and James Fleet as Constable, plays in the show, presenting the two painters bickering on Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy in 1832. Turner added a touch of red, in the form of a buoy, to his seascape Helvoetsluys; the City of Utrecht, 64, Going to Sea in order to upstage Constable\u2019s The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, on which the painter had been working for more than a decade. But whatever their rivalry entailed, it was hardly the odd-couple bromance between Van Gogh and Gauguin depicted in the 1956 Vincente Minnelli movie Lust for Life (Gauguin: \u201cYou paint too fast!\u201d Van Gogh: \u201cYou look too fast!\u201d). It is worth remembering that Constable once wrote in a letter: \u201cDid you ever see a picture by Turner, and not wish to possess it?\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/nov/25/turner-constable-review-tate-britain\">Continue reading...</a>",

In the first five minutes, we\u2019ve experienced huge riffs, pillars of fire and supernatural horror-inspired visuals. Formed in 2015, the US band found mainstream success in 2022 with their third album The Death of Peace of Mind, which embraced the kind of hooky pop songwriting and complex storytelling that made the band irresistible on TikTok. Although their fourth studio album is yet to be released, this tour represents their graduation to the same league as genre titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/bring-me-the-horizon\">Bring Me the Horizon</a>, who they supported last year. Opener Specter is enough to justify this step up: an anthemic recent single as atmospheric as the dry ice crawling around frontman Noah Sebastian.</p><p>Although tonight\u2019s set list is rooted in metal, it showcases the band\u2019s ambitions towards other genres, incorporating elements of industrial, electronica and drum\u2019n\u2019bass. This fluid approach is anchored by Sebastian\u2019s supremely adaptable vocals, which switch from croon to scream to whisper, even deftly mimicking the flow of metal princess Poppy during their collaborative single VAN. Dying to Love is pleasingly gothic, Nowhere to Go is relatively perky pop punk, and Impose finds commonality between breakbeats and double-kick metal drums. Drummer Nick Folio deserves a particular mention for balancing visceral crunch with expansive resonance. The band\u2019s willingness to lean into zeitgeisty pop sounds is key to their mainstream appeal: The Death of Peace of Mind is reminiscent of the gloomy R&amp;B of the Weeknd, by way of Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 all falsetto and moody beats with heavy metal drops.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/24/bad-omens-review-ovo-hydro-glasgow\">Continue reading...</a>",

But there is also ascetic Thomas More, hiding his cruel streak behind fine bones, and sly yet thuggish Thomas Cromwell, with those shifty eyes and the beginnings of a double chin. \u201cHans the Painter\u201d did the wives too \u2013 an appropriately sketchy drawing of Anne Boleyn, a saintly portrait of Jane Seymour who died after giving birth to Henry\u2019s heir, and a pin-up version of Anne of&nbsp;Cleves.</p><p>It was this last portrait that caused an international incident in 1539 when Holbein was sent by Henry to the Low Countries to check whether Anne was pretty enough to be his next wife. Based on Holbein\u2019s portrait, Henry committed to the marriage in absentia, only to be horrified when the actual Anne arrived on the Kentish coast, looking \u201cnothing so fair as she hath been reported\u201d.

Over the past few decades, though, our understanding of it has evolved and (arguably) overshot \u2013 now, there are plenty of personal trainers who will insist that you should be loosening it up with a foam roller, or even harnessing its magical elastic powers to jump higher and do more press-ups. But what\u2019s it <em>really</em> doing \u2013 and is there a way you can actually take advantage of it?</p><p>\u201cThe easiest way to describe fascia is to think about the structure of a tangerine,\u201d says Natasha Kilian, a specialist in musculoskeletal physiotherapy at Pure Sports Medicine. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the outer skin, and beneath that, the white pith that separates the segments and holds them together. Fascia works in a similar way: it\u2019s a continuous, all-encompassing network that wraps around and connects everything in the body, from muscles and nerves to blood vessels and organs. It\u2019s essentially the body\u2019s internal wetsuit, keeping everything supported and integrated.\u201d If you\u2019ve ever carved a joint of meat, it\u2019s the thin, silvery layer wrapped around the muscle, like clingfilm.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/nov/24/secrets-of-the-body-what-is-fascia-health-foam-roller\">Continue reading...</a>",

Door de storing liep het terrein onder met slib en kon afvalwater niet meer volledig worden gezuiverd. De brandweer pompte het overtollige water weg, maar als tijdelijke maatregel voert het waterschap het afvalwater nu via een bypass af naar de Maas. Door de sterke stroming kan de rivier het beter verdunnen dan de kleine slootjes in de omgeving. Bewoners van het Land van Cuijk worden opgeroepen zo min mogelijk afvalwater te produceren totdat het probleem is verholpen, om verdere lozing te beperken.",

Kamina is currently being held at Moscow\u2019s notorious Matrosskaya Tishina prison. <br/>Following the sentencing, Kamina\u2019s lawyer Natalia Tikhonova said that the court had handed down \u201ca monstrous term for a non-violent crime\u201d, <a href=\"https://t.me/novaya_pishet/54775\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to Novaya Gazeta.",

Among the other clauses to be scrapped are the proposal to allocate $100 billion from frozen Russian assets to the reconstruction of Ukraine, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/top-zelenskiy-aide-sees-progress-on-peace-deal-with-new-document?srnd=homepage-europe\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to Bloomberg. <br/>Ukraine\u2019s First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya told the FT that the US was also likely to agree to scrap a requirement limiting the size of the Ukrainian army to 600,000 troops.

She later became its fatality, having suffered burns to 45% of her body and to her respiratory tract. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/f2bd239ba4ad4af395cc9f4e6b2680e5.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Emergency services work the site of a Russian strike on a nine-storey residential building in Kyiv, Ukraine, 14 November 2025, amid the Russian invasion. At least four people were killed and dozens others injured, including two children, as a result of the overnight combined Russian attacks on Kyiv using more than 400 shock drones and about 20 missiles of different types, according to the Kyiv City Military Administration. EPA/MAXYM MARUSENKO.</figcaption><br/>The woman was Natalia Khodymchuk, the widow of Valery Khodymchuk, who died on 26 April 1986 when reactor number 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, beginning the series of events that would lead to the worst nuclear disaster in history.  <br/>Having heroically remained at his workplace until the bitter end, Khodymchuk remains inside the reactor today, as his remains were never recovered from the radioactive fire that consumed him. Posthumously awarded both Soviet, and Ukrainian post-independence honours, Khodymchuk, was officially deemed to have been Chernobyl\u2019s first victim. <br/>Following the events of April 1986, Natalia Khodymchuk was evacuated from the exclusion zone with her son and daughter, and subsequently moved into a brand new, 18-storey block of flats on the outskirts of Kyiv, where, ironically, there was almost nothing but another power station. <br/>At the time, cynics said that the \u201cChernobyl veterans\u201d had been deliberately placed together and their children sent to their own schools and kindergartens on the outskirts of the city to ensure that they couldn\u2019t pass their radiation sickness on to the rest of Kyiv\u2019s population. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/95a2682e05df4327b830f257820108aea/large\"/><figcaption>The abandoned city of Pripyat, in Ukraine\u2019s Kyiv region. Photo: Lesha53.</figcaption><br/>But that cynicism soon faded, especially once it emerged that radioactive fallout from Chernobyl had spread to Kyiv as well, and people were advised not to take their children to that year\u2019s May Day parade in the city centre. Yet the message from Moscow was always the same: the accident had been localised, there was no threat, and Soviet citizens should not listen to enemy propaganda.  <br/>In 1996, to mark the 10th anniversary of his death, Khodymchuk was symbolically buried alongside 30 other fire-fighters and members of power plant staff at Moscow\u2019s Mitinskoe Cemetery, all of whom had been buried there for decades.  <br/>Unlike Khodymchuk, those already buried at the site had died in Moscow\u2019s Hospital Number Six within months of the disaster. Hospital Six was the only medical facility in the USSR able to diagnose patients with \u201cradiation sickness\u201d. Indeed, all Chernobyl \u201cvictims\u201d were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/entertainment/2015/04/150424_chornobul_first_victims_dk\" target=\"_blank\">buried</a> in zinc coffins and had their graves filled in with concrete to create their own mini-sarcophagi. \u201e <br/>The story of Valery and Natalia meeting at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is as simple as the plot of any Soviet film about love on the production line.   <br/>Natalia placed her prized possession, the shirt Khodymchuk had worn before leaving for his fatal last shift, into her husband\u2019s notional coffin. \u201cI didn\u2019t wash it. I could smell Valery on the shirt for a long time,\u201d Natalia said almost 40 years later. <br/>Following the severe injuries she sustained earlier this month, Natalia\u2019s friends and family from the Chernobyl veterans\u2019 organisation <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/articles/c30v5rg9pz9o\" target=\"_blank\">came</a> to visit her in the burns unit. Even then, she was keen to talk about her late husband, and appeared worried that people would forget certain details of his life or otherwise get the facts of his tragic death wrong.  <br/>The story of Valery and Natalia meeting at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant is as simple as the plot of any Soviet film about love on the production line.

They went dancing at weekends in her village, Kopachi, after which Valery would make the long walk back home. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/232bbded59a04ae78880ed4218303861a/large\"/><figcaption>Natalia Khodymchuk in the exclusion zone, 2024.

I was at my loom, weaving a rug with flowers,\u201d Natalia recalls in her memoirs. \u201cI was embarrassed that he saw how poor my home life was and what sort of clothes I wore around the house. But he had come to propose.\u201d  <br/>Initially, the newlyweds lived in a mobile home until they received an apartment in Pripyat, the town where Chernobyl workers lived that has now been deserted for almost four decades.  <br/>Every year, Natalia Khodymchuk <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/entertainment/2015/04/150424_chornobul_first_victims_dk\" id=\"q3qu1w4t1\" target=\"_blank\">went</a> to Moscow\u2019s Mitinskoe Cemetery for two decades in a row, until the war in Donbas made the trip too difficult once Ukrainians became undesirable guests in Russia. After that, Khodymchuk chose to leave her flowers each year at either the memorial plaque or the chapel in Chernobyl instead. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/697e4ec8f255453f8410eda9b3e432b1a/large\"/><figcaption>Natalia and Valery Khodymchuk, 1980s, Chernobyl.

That same year, Natalia became a grandmother, and her grand-daughter was named Valeria, after her grandfather, pictures of whom still hang on the walls of the family home.  <br/>In the early hours of 14 November, a Shahed <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/14/four-killed-and-dozens-more-injured-in-wicked-overnight-russian-airstrikes-on-kyiv-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">struck</a> the building in Kyiv where many Chernobyl survivors \u2014 pensioners with a mass of chronic diseases \u2014 were living. Where could they run to and hide every night? Their possessions consisted of little more than the awards they received for their valiant work and the few family photo albums they were able to take with them as they fled from Pripyat 40 years ago.  <br/>Among the residents was a Hero of Ukraine, Oleksiy Ananenko, a former mechanical engineer at Chernobyl and one of three volunteers who, putting their own lives at great risk, managed to prevent a second explosion at the power plant. Had it happened, the consequences for the rest of Europe could have been catastrophic. <br/>A sarcophagus now covers the site of the disaster, and a poem on a memorial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Khodemchuk#/media/File:Khodemchuk_memorial.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">plaque</a> dedicated to Khodymchuk\u2019s sacrifice reads: You did not leave your post, You stood like men in battle.

Photo: Courts' Press Service.</figcaption><br/>A Russian woman has been sentenced to seven years in prison after a Moscow court found her guilty of spreading false information about the Russian military in a series of social media posts, Russian state-owned news agency TASS <a href=\"https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/25703385\">reported</a> on Sunday. <br/>Varvara Volkova, 23, was found to have posted information about the Russian military \u201ccommitting violent acts aimed at destroying the civilian population\u201d in a Telegram channel for residents of Sapronovo, a small village in the Moscow region, the court\u2019s press service <a href=\"https://t.me/Mos_obl_sud/51\">said</a>.  <br/>Volkova\u2019s posts, in which she <a href=\"https://tass.ru/proisshestviya/25703385\">said</a>, among other things, that she would treat the Ukrainian military to tea if they managed to capture the Moscow region, were first <a href=\"https://t.me/grafynia/31627\">brought</a> to the attention of the authorities earlier this year when pro-Kremlin Telegram channels shared an audio recording of her calling a Russian tank crew serviceman to insult him for taking part in the war in Ukraine. The serviceman subsequently <a href=\"https://t.me/cremeasmersh/1361\">died</a> fighting in Ukraine in March. <br/>Several pro-Russian bloggers, including Alexander Talipov, who has been <a href=\"https://ctrcenter.org/en/talipov-is-increasingly-tracking-down-pro-ukrainian-crimeans-a-new-denunciation-for-a-song-by-verka-serduchka\">accused</a> of informing against pro-Ukrainian residents of Russian-annexed Crimea, <a href=\"https://t.me/cremeasmersh/1290\">wrote</a> about Volkova\u2019s posts and demanded that she be fired from her job as a stewardess at Ural Airlines and face criminal charges.  <br/>Soon after the bloggers began posting about her, Volkova had two separate administrative cases opened against her, including one for \u201cdiscrediting\u201d the Russian army, for which she was fined 31,000 rubles (\u20ac340), <a href=\"https://zona.media/news/2025/11/23/v-volkova\">according</a> to Russian independent news outlet Mediazona. <br/>Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, dozens of journalists, activists, and ordinary citizens in Russia have been sentenced to custodial sentences after being convicted of spreading false information about the Russian military under the country\u2019s wartime censorship laws. <br/>Prominent cases include that of journalist Maria Ponomarenko, <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/04/17/jailed-russian-journalist-goes-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-censorship-and-lack-of-privacy-en-news\">sentenced</a> to six years in prison for a Telegram post about the bombing of a Mariupol theatre, and artist Sasha Skochilenko, who <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/05/20/human-price-carrier\">replaced</a> supermarket price tags with anti-war messages and received seven years in prison, before she was<a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/08/02/catch-and-release-en\" id=\"de2xwb2jy\"> released</a> in an August 2024 prisoner exchange. <br/>In June, Russia\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld the legality of the country\u2019s wartime censorship laws, following a legal<a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/04/28/jailed-russian-politician-challenges-law-which-convicted-him-en-news\" id=\"ky4tnawp7\"> challenge</a> filed by the defence team of jailed opposition deputy Alexey Gorinov, 63, who was<a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/07/08/seven-years-in-prison-for-moscow-legislator-over-army-discrediting-charges-news\" id=\"h6jar0cqc\"> sentenced</a> to seven years in prison in 2022 for calling Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine a war and mourning the deaths of Ukrainian children at a council meeting.",

US President Donald Trump told reporters on Saturday night that the 28-point plan was not his \u201cfinal offer,\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-says-u-s-peace-plan-not-his-final-offer-to-ukraines-zelenskyy\">maintained</a> that peace \u201cone way or the other\u201d needed to be achieved quickly.  <br/>A number of senior figures are expected to take part in the Geneva meeting, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Ukrainian Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, with just days remaining until the Thursday deadline given to Kyiv to accept the plan. <br/>Under the 28-point <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/20/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-28-points-russia\">plan</a>, Ukraine would cede the whole of Crimea and Donbas to Russia, while the present line of contact in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions would be frozen, essentially granting Moscow de facto control of large areas of both. <br/>In return, Ukraine would be provided with \u201creliable security guarantees\u201d by the US and European-backed air defences operated from Poland. Moscow would be invited back into the G8, and $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be channelled into US-led reconstruction projects in Ukraine, with Washington taking a 50% share of the profits.",

Ukraine is having a very <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/21/ukraine-denies-russias-claim-to-have-captured-key-city-of-kupyansk-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">difficult time</a> at the moment on various fronts. The fall of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine is a question of when, not if, and of how many men both sides will lose before Russia captures the ruins of the city. <br/>Russia has also upped pressure on the Zaporizhzhian part of the front and around Kherson on the coast. It is very likely that the Kremlin will continue to push its current advantages, with fighting possibly increasing in the north again around Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/17/four-dead-and-11-injured-in-overnight-russian-strikes-on-ukraines-kharkiv-region-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">Kharkiv</a>. <br/>For now, the war of attrition clearly favours Russia. But from a purely military perspective, neither the fall of Pokrovsk nor further Russian territorial gains elsewhere spell the danger of an imminent Ukrainian collapse. \u201e <br/>War is never solely a military endeavour \u2014 it also requires political will and financial resources.  <br/>However, war is never solely a military endeavour \u2014 it also requires political will and financial resources. A more existential threat to Ukraine\u2019s war effort, therefore, is the continuing fallout from the corruption scandal. Here, too, certainties are few and far between. <br/>A characteristic feature of political scandals in Ukraine is the difficulty of predicting the reaction of Ukrainian society. Some incidents can become a trigger for large-scale protests that lead to massive change. <br/>This was the case with the Euromaidan <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/11/21/ukraine-marks-10th-anniversary-of-maidan-uprising-en\">revolution</a> in 2014. The revolution triggered a chain of events, from the annexation of Crimea to the Russian-proxy occupation of parts of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, to the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/745e4226fd3a4dd58b28aa4b017e604da/large\"/><figcaption>A woman holds a picture of former commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, during a rally supporting him on Kyiv\u2019s Independence Square, 9 February 2024. Photo: EPA / SERGEY DOLZHENKO.</figcaption><br/>Other political crises pass without major upheaval. This was the case with the <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/02/08/oleksandr-syrskyi-appointed-new-commander-in-chief-of-ukrainian-armed-forces-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">dismissal</a> of the popular commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, in 2024. Widely seen as a possible challenger to Volodymyr Zelensky in future presidential elections, Zaluzhnyi was subsequently sent into exile as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to London. <br/>So far, the current corruption scandal has not sparked mass protests in Ukraine. Nor has there been a very harsh response from European leaders. But the fact that <a href=\"https://english.nv.ua/nation/shabunin-warns-new-mindich-tapes-may-expose-zelenskyy-s-inner-circle-and-test-anti-graft-resolve-50561619.html\" target=\"_blank\">virtually all</a> of Zelensky\u2019s inner circle is involved in corruption, according to Ukraine\u2019s national anti-corruption bureau (NABU), has forced the president to launch a comprehensive response. <br/>Sanctions were imposed on Timur Mindich, Zelensky\u2019s long-term friend and business partner, who fled the country just hours before NABU raids on 10 November. Then, a week after the latest scandal broke, Ukraine\u2019s parliament <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/13/ukraines-justice-and-energy-ministers-resign-amid-widening-corruption-probe-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">dismissed</a> the ministers of justice and energy, Herman Halushchenko and Svitlana Hrynchuk, who were both involved in the scandal. <br/>Meanwhile, Zelensky himself has embarked on a whistle-stop diplomatic tour of European capitals to shore up support for his beleaguered government and country. <br/>He managed to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0ex0y0p31jo\" target=\"_blank\">secure</a> deliveries of US liquefied natural gas imports from Greece, which should help Ukraine through the difficult winter months. A landmark military deal with France also promises improved air defences for Ukraine in the short term, and the <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/17/zelensky-signs-deal-committing-ukraine-to-buy-100-french-fighter-jets-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">delivery</a> of 100 fighter jets over the next decade. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/55fabaf1d31f4f1da0cabce87243411da/large\"/><figcaption>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron embrace after signing an agreement at the Villacoublay Air Base near Paris, France, 17 November 2025. Photo: EPA / Christophe Ena.</figcaption><br/>Important as they are, these are stopgap measures rather than game changers. And not even all the necessary stopgap measures are done deals. The EU and its member states are still <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-options-ukraine-financing-russia-war/33594928.html\" target=\"_blank\">prevaricating</a> on an urgently needed loan to Ukraine. If this loan does not materialise, Kyiv will run out of money in February to pay its soldiers, civil servants and pensioners. <br/>In the meantime, Zelensky is also facing <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/11/18/8007753/index.amp\" target=\"_blank\">pressure</a> from his own parliamentary faction, Servant of the People. He will be keen to present his tour of Europe to them as a vote of confidence by his Western allies. Yet he may also still have to offer the resignation of his longtime ally Andriy Yermak, who was also implicated in the latest corruption scandal. <br/>As head of the presidential office, Yermak is sometimes <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/who-is-andriy-yermak-and-can-ukraines-new-corruption-scandal-finally-sink-him/\" target=\"_blank\">considered</a> the de facto ruler of Ukraine. Dismissing him would probably please Zelensky\u2019s domestic and foreign critics. Not doing so, on the other hand, should not be seen as a sign of strength. The very fact that the position of such a key ally is up for discussion is a further sign that Zelensky\u2019s political power is, perhaps, fatally weakened. \u201e <br/>If Kyiv\u2019s Western allies get the sense that Ukraine and Zelensky are lost causes, militarily and politically, they may cut their losses and retrench.  <br/>Critically missing in all of this are three things. The first is a Ukrainian succession plan. Opposition politicians such as former president Petro Poroshenko and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko are as unpopular as they are tainted by allegations of corruption during their terms in office. <br/>There is no clear route to replacing Zelensky if he refuses to step down. And even if he were replaced, a broader-based coalition government is unlikely to find a magic wand to turn Ukraine\u2019s precarious military situation around. <br/>The second unknown is the White House and its dealings with the Kremlin to come up with a 28-point <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/21/zelensky-warns-ukraine-faces-difficult-choice-as-us-pushes-kyiv-to-accept-peace-plan-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">peace plan</a>, which Washington has <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/22/us-ramps-up-pressure-on-ukraine-to-accept-peace-plan-by-thursday-in-nauseating-meeting-en-news\">insisted</a> Kyiv approve by Thursday. Yet again, this plan requires major concessions from Ukraine on territory and the future size of its army, while providing no effective security guarantees. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/5bfed08753b04ff98128321727b4fccea/large\"/><figcaption>The site of a Russian missile strike on a high-rise residential building in Ternopil, western Ukraine, 20 November 2025. Photo: EPA / MAXYM MARUSENKO.</figcaption><br/>European foreign ministers have been quick to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-europeans-must-be-board-with-any-plan-end-war-eu-ministers-say-2025-11-20/\" target=\"_blank\">insist</a> that any peace plan needs Ukrainian and European backing. But their appetite to push back hard may be waning. If Kyiv\u2019s Western allies get the sense that Ukraine and Zelensky are lost causes, militarily and politically, they may cut their losses and retrench. <br/>This would probably see these countries beef up their own defences and sign up to a US-backed plan that trades Ukrainian land and sovereignty for the extremely slim prospects of Russia accepting such a bargain. <br/>The third critical unknown is whether Vladimir Putin will cut a deal or drag out negotiations with Trump and push on regardless in Ukraine. Putin\u2019s past track record of playing for time speaks for itself. <br/>Recent <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-nothing-new-report-ukraine-peace-proposals-2025-11-19/\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov that there were no new developments to announce on a possible peace plan also strongly suggest that there has been no change in the Kremlin\u2019s approach. Given what is apparently on the table, even if Putin were inclined to make a deal, it would hardly be of comfort for Kyiv and Brussels. <br/>The danger for Kyiv and its European partners is that talk of Ukraine\u2019s political and military collapse turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The consequence of that \u2014 Kyiv\u2019s submission to a Russian peace diktat \u2014 would be the result of the dysfunctional nature of Ukraine\u2019s domestic politics and the fecklessness of Western support as much as any collusion between Trump and Putin.   <br/><br/>Stefan Wolff is a Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham and Tetyana Malyarenko is a Professor of International Relations at the Odesa Law Academy. <br/>This <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/ukraine-and-europes-weakness-exposed-as-us-and-russia-again-negotiate-behind-kyivs-back-270104\">article</a> was first published by The Conversation.

Even children whose mother tongue is Russian have been known to fail the test, which was introduced in April. <br/>The move to restrict access to education for non-Russians is just one of the policies that have been introduced as part of a crackdown on immigration following last year\u2019s deadly terror <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/03/23/the-deadliest-terror-attack-in-russia-in-20-years-in-pictures-en\" target=\"_blank\">attack</a> on Moscow\u2019s Crocus City Hall, 14 of the 15 alleged perpetrators of which came from Tajikistan.  <br/>Shortly after the attack, the Russian authorities set up a register of illegal migrants and police were granted new powers to deport migrants found to have committed even minor offences.  <br/>According to a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325071266_Vozmoznosti_adaptacii_detej_migrantov_v_skolah_Moskvy_i_Podmoskova\">study</a> of eight schools conducted by Moscow\u2019s Higher School of Economics, migrant children often end up at less prestigious or underperforming schools and are often placed in classes alongside children with learning disabilities.",

The general feeling among European officials was that Washington was taking advantage of Zelensky\u2019s vulnerability in the wake of a corruption <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/13/ukraines-justice-and-energy-ministers-resign-amid-widening-corruption-probe-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">scandal</a> involving several of his close associates to force him to acquiesce to a rushed peace agreement, the FT wrote. <br/>With the message coming from the US making the situation increasingly desperate for Kyiv and with Europe looking ever more sidelined,  <br/>With Kyiv subject to a US ultimatum and Europe increasingly sidelined by its NATO ally, several European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met late into the night on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, to discuss ways they could slow down the process, the FT reported.  <br/>On Friday evening, Zelensky <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/news/yednist-potribna-nam-yak-nikoli-abi-v-nashomu-domi-buv-dosto-101493\" target=\"_blank\">addressed</a> Ukrainians in a video message, warning that the country faced \u201ca difficult choice\u201d in the coming days, whether to accept the latest US peace plan or brace itself for \u201ca very tough winter\u201d.  <br/>Under the 28-point <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/20/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-28-points-russia\" target=\"_blank\">plan</a>, Ukraine would cede the whole of Crimea and Donbas to Russia, while the present line of contact in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions would be frozen, essentially granting Moscow de facto control of large areas of both. <br/>In return, Ukraine would be provided with \u201creliable security guarantees\u201d by the US, and European fighter jets to defend the country from future invasion would be stationed in Poland.

One source familiar with the process told Reuters that Trump would like Ukraine to sign a framework agreement with Russia by next Thursday, in time for Thanksgiving in the US. <br/>One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Kyiv was under greater pressure from Washington than at any time during any previous peace discussions. \u201cThey want to stop the war and want Ukraine to pay the price,\u201d Reuters quoted the source as saying. <br/>In his nightly address to Ukrainians on Thursday, Zelensky<a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/americi-po-silah-zrobiti-tak-shob-rosijska-nalashtovanist-na-101481\"> said</a> a US military delegation, headed by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, had presented the plan in a \u201cvery serious conversation\u201d in the Ukrainian capital on Thursday and that he would meet with US President Donald Trump in the coming days to discuss it further.  <br/>Under the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/11/20/trump-ukraine-peace-plan-28-points-russia\">plan</a>, Ukraine would cede the whole of Crimea and Donbas to Russia, while the present line of contact in Ukraine\u2019s Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions would be frozen, essentially granting Moscow de facto control of large areas of both.

    "summary": "<br/>The potential departure of Margarita Simonyan from her role as editor-in-chief of the propaganda broadcaster once known as Russia Today serves as a stark reminder of just how much the world has changed since the Kremlin created the network to burnish its international reputation and project Russian soft power in 2005. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/2486f460f9bf44f999bd5e16c87d1764.jpeg\"/><figcaption>RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan makes a speech during the network\u2019s 20th anniversary celebrations at Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Theatre, 17 October 2025. Photo: EPA / Pavel Bednyakov.</figcaption><br/>Few Kremlin shills have been as ferocious or as impactful as Simonyan, who has spent the past two decades demonising the West, lying about Ukraine, and fanatically defending Vladimir Putin at every turn, and her <a href=\"https://www.moscowtimes.ru/2025/09/08/glava-russia-today-margarita-simonyan-mozhet-pokinut-dolzhnost-iz-za-raka-a173822\" target=\"_blank\">rumoured</a> departure, if confirmed, could have existential implications for the network.  <br/>At a lavish reception held at Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Theatre to mark RT\u2019s 20th anniversary last month, Putin himself heaped praise on Simonyan, praising her resilience in the face of what he described as Western-led efforts to muzzle the controversial broadcaster, while also acknowledging the \u201cdifficult period\u201d she has been going through following her recent breast cancer <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/08/russian-propagandist-margarita-simonyan-to-step-back-from-rt-after-breast-cancer-diagnosis-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">diagnosis</a> and the <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/26/prominent-russian-propagandist-and-husband-of-rt-chief-simonyan-dies-after-months-in-coma-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">death</a> of her propagandist film director husband Tigran Keosayan in September.  <br/>Handpicked by Putin at the age of 25 to head up Russia\u2019s response to an international media landscape he saw as dominated by the Anglosphere, Simonyan can be credited with bringing about the network\u2019s early success, launching its wildly popular Arabic- and Spanish-language news channels, <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/who-is-margarita-simonyan-rt-editor-in-chief-19471333.htm\" target=\"_blank\">becoming</a> a five-time international Emmy finalist, and at one point <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-state-news-outlet-rt-thrives-on-youtube-facebook-1508808937\" target=\"_blank\">being</a> the most-watched news channel on YouTube. <br/>Hailing from a blue-collar, ethnic Armenian household in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus and not attending a prestigious Moscow university, unlike most rising stars in Putin\u2019s Russia, Simonyan had to work hard for her seat at the table in a country where one\u2019s career trajectory is built on personal connections rather than individual merit. <br/>It was during Simonyan\u2019s time as a member of the Kremlin press pool in the early 2000s that she got to know Putin\u2019s then-spokesperson Alexey Gromov, who would go on to found RT in an effort to recalibrate the image of Russia being painted internationally. The choice of Simonyan to lead the new broadcaster in 2005 was in no small part due to her Kremlin-friendly <a href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/faces-of-kremlin-propaganda-margarita-simonyan/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> on the Beslan school siege the year before, in which some 334 people were <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/08/22/beslan-20-years-on-en\" target=\"_blank\">killed</a> in a botched storming of the building by Russian special forces. <br/>Another factor that gave Simonyan an edge over her rivals was the year she spent as a high-school exchange student in New Hampshire, which gave her first-hand experience of life in the West and thus greater authority to push anti-American narratives.  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/ed4781494190436982508fbeeddd0817a/large\"/><figcaption>Moscow\u2019s Bolshoi Theatre is lit up in green to mark RT\u2019s 20th anniversary, 17 October 2025. Photo: EPA / Valeriy Sharifulin / Sputnik / Kremlin Pool.</figcaption><br/>Time spent living in the United States has similarly helped fellow Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov excel as a regime mouthpiece since returning to Russia, and it was on his prime time chat show in September that Simonyan chose to announce the news of her recent cancer diagnosis. <br/>Whereas Solovyov routinely draws on his experience of living and working in Alabama during the 1990s to dispel the notion that he harbours any resentment toward the American people, thus allowing him to establish an ideological kinship with like-minded MAGA conservatives, Simonyan\u2019s biggest <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/11/russia-disinformation-margarita-simonyan/\" target=\"_blank\">takeaway</a> from her time in the US was its deplorable education system and the \u201cill-informed\u201d youth it churns out as a result. <br/>Ever since Putin launched Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, RT\u2019s original mission to \u201cbreak the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on global information streams\u201d has taken a backseat to establishing the network as the voice of the Global South in a time of rapid geopolitical change.  <br/>Simonyan\u2019s approach to the war in Ukraine has involved shamelessly misrepresenting the high regard some in Ukraine have for the country\u2019s problematic 20th century independence leader Stepan Bandera as evidence of the country\u2019s \u201cneo-Nazi problem\u201d, actions fed by her own conviction that, whatever happens on the battlefield, Russia must not be allowed to lose control of the narrative, as happened during Russia\u2019s 2008 invasion of Georgia.  <br/>Despite an EU investigation <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/georgia-started-war-with-russia-eu-backed-report-idUSTRE58T4MO/\" target=\"_blank\">confirming</a> that former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili provoked the five-day war in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Simonyan has expressed her frustration that Russia is still seen as the aggressor in Georgia by those in the West, something she has admitted RT should have done more to address at the time. <br/>Simonyan\u2019s talent and slavish devotion to laundering the Kremlin\u2019s international reputation has meant that Dmitry Kiselyov, the CEO of RT\u2019s parent company Rossiya Segodnya, has never given much thought to nurturing a successor should she ever stand down, and an obvious heir has yet to emerge. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/a24e2ccbe31f46f5a001a6a409eae70ba/large\"/><figcaption>Vladimir Putin and Margarita Simonyan on the sidelines of RT\u2019s 20th anniversary celebrations at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, 17 October 2025. Photo: EPA / Pavel Bednyakov.</figcaption><br/>Indeed, in the two decades since the network was founded, the role of running RT has become a far less enviable one, with anybody taking over the reins at this juncture likely to find themselves sanctioned by the West, having a target painted on their back by the Security Service of Ukraine, and even being indicted by the International Criminal Court for actively supporting the invasion of Ukraine and the crimes against humanity being committed there in Moscow\u2019s name. <br/>As Russia continues to boost its year-on-year military expenditure having yet to show any readiness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine in good faith, RT\u2019s soft power projection will require further belt-tightening. Moreover, and by virtue of Russia\u2019s current political isolation on the global stage, trips abroad taken by Simonyan\u2019s eventual heir will be confined to RT\u2019s target markets in the Global South as opposed to the Euro-Atlantic region.  <br/>Should bipartisan legislation <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-terror-sponsor-ukraine-us-sanctions/33535012.html\" target=\"_blank\">designating</a> Russia a State Sponsor of Terrorism become US law, RT will find itself on the Financial Action Task Force\u2019s blacklist and thus unable to pay its overseas staff. Needless to say, such a bold move would make life that much harder for any eventual successor to Simonyan. <br/>When Simonyan does finally leave RT, Western governments should see her departure as an opportunity to further tighten the screws on the broadcaster as a source of Russian propaganda and dangerous disinformation until the Kremlin finally concludes that it is no longer commercially viable to keep the channel operational.    <br/><br/>Saahil Menon is a freelance journalist based in Dubai.

Gerasimov added that 80% of the Kharkiv region city of Vovchansk and 70% of the Donetsk region city of Pokrovsk were also now under Russian control. <br/>Putin, who noted that fighting was continuing in the Donetsk region city of Kostyantynivka, said that Ukrainian servicemen should be given the opportunity to surrender to the advancing Russian military, although Gerasimov said that AFU fighters wishing to do so were being threatened with execution by their comrades. <br/>Calling the Ukrainian leadership a \u201ccriminal group\u201d that held power \u201cfor the sake of its own enrichment\u201d, Putin reiterated that \u201cthe goals of the \u2018special military operation\u2019 must be fully achieved\u201d. <br/>Rejecting the Russian claims, the AFU said on Thursday that its troops in Kupyansk were continuing to identify and take out covert Russian military units on the outskirts of the city, and denied the claims made by Gerasimov about the Russian military\u2019s near-total control of Vovchansk and Pokrovsk. <br/>Search and assault operations and the elimination of the enemy were ongoing in Pokrovsk, it continued, while \u201cadditional logistics routes to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad are being organised to ensure the provision of our units\u201d.  <br/>Kupyansk has been the focus of intense Russian military pressure since late 2024, and the fall of the city, a major rail hub close to Ukraine\u2019s second city Kharkiv, would be a serious blow to Kyiv as it would compromise vital AFU supply lines in eastern Ukraine.",

In addition, $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be \u201cinvested in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\u201d, with the US to receive 50% of profits from the ventures. <br/>In his nightly address to Ukrainians, Zelensky <a href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/americi-po-silah-zrobiti-tak-shob-rosijska-nalashtovanist-na-101481\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> a US military delegation, headed by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, had presented the plan in a \u201cvery serious conversation\u201d in the Ukrainian capital on Thursday and that he would meet with US President Donald Trump in the coming days to discuss it further. <br/>\u201cFrom the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace,\u201d Zelensky said, stressing that Kyiv was ready for \u201chonest work\u201d with the US on the proposals but that a peace deal should \u201crespect our independence, our sovereignty and the dignity of the Ukrainian people\u201d. <br/>The US plan <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/06/14/putin-lists-preconditions-for-negotiations-with-kyiv-on-eve-of-swiss-peace-summit-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">echoes</a> the maximalist peace terms repeatedly put forward by Vladimir Putin and Kremlin officials since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  <br/>It was reportedly drafted primarily by Trump\u2019s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with input from Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev but no consultations with Kyiv or its European allies. Earlier this week, Dmitriev <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/19/us-hopes-to-reach-new-peace-deal-on-ukraine-as-soon-as-this-week-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">praised</a> the Trump administration\u2019s approach to ending the war, saying Moscow felt its position was \u201creally being heard\u201d. <br/>While a report by Axios on Wednesday <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/20/zelensky-reportedly-not-interested-in-discussing-new-us-peace-plan-on-ukraine-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that Zelensky was \u201cnot interested\u201d in discussing the plan, The Financial Times (FT) <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26beeac1-bbe3-455b-97f6-84cf7c7c86fe\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on Thursday that the Trump administration was pushing Zelensky to sign the agreement by Thanksgiving on 27 November as the US pursues an \u201caggressive\u201d timeline to end the war this year. <br/>That timeline is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d, however, with Kyiv working on counterproposals as several of the US plan\u2019s points cross its red lines, the FT said. According to The Wall Street Journal, European leaders also hope to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/u-s-peace-plan-for-ukraine-faces-resistance-from-europe-and-kyiv-0f2bb501\" target=\"_blank\">present</a> a \u201cmore favourable\u201d plan to Kyiv over the coming days.",

She now resides outside of Russia. <br/>The 17-minute film, shot in Latvia and directed by exiled Russian director Alexander Molochnikov, won Best Film and received the jury prize at the BAFTA Student Film Awards. It has also caught the attention of prominent film director, producer and actor Ben Stiller, as well as Oscar-winning producer John Lesher, who have <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/11/ben-stiller-john-lesher-oscar-short-extremist-1236614039/\" target=\"_blank\">joined</a> the project as executive producers. <br/>Novaya Gazeta Europe spoke to Molochnikov, who made the film as his Columbia University graduation project, about the film-making process, his reaction to Shochilenko\u2019s unexpected release and the involvement of Stiller and Lesher. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/e0d5c008231549cea1b3c982674f8c64a/large\"/><figcaption>Alexander Molochnikov with cameraman Mikhail Krichman on the set of Extremist. Photo: Molochnikov private archive .</figcaption><br/>NGE: The film is in Russian and uses Russian actors. Was that your decision? <br/>AM: Festival short films are so specific and I thought it would somehow be pretentious to tell this story \u2014 and I really wanted to tell it \u2014 in English. There are examples of Russian stories, happening in Russia, filmed by Russian directors, being made in English, like <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2963262/\" target=\"_blank\">Limonov</a>, The Ballad of Eddie, by Kirill <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/05/20/kirill-serebrennikov-uses-cannes-press-conference-to-speak-out-against-prosecution-of-fellow-artists-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">Serebrennikov</a>. It\u2019s a great movie. But this time it felt more honest to do it in Russian. <br/>NGE: You made the film as your graduation project at Columbia University. Was shooting the film in Russian a problem there? <br/>AM: Not at all! Columbia University has students from 20 to 30 countries in a single class. Everyone films in their own languages, and adds subtitles. <br/>NGE: So who is the film for, Russian or Western viewers? <br/>AM: The film is for anyone who can think and feel. I hope that people in Russia will be able to see it too, but that\u2019s not up to us. I\u2019ve got to say it was important for me to strike a balance when we were filming: to try to explain things someone here in America may not know, but not slip into the trap of over-explaining.  \u201e <br/>\u201cIt already did become an American story, to some extent, while we were shooting and releasing the film, because people are being detained at protests here now too.\u201d  <br/>Actually, that\u2019s important in everything we do. Our staging of the play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/12/seagull-true-story-review-marylebone-theatre-london\" target=\"_blank\">Seagull: True Story</a> was also basically us trying to strike a balance: not to be too incomprehensible, because of the different cultural codes here, but not to descend into nonsense either.  <br/>NGE: In one interview, you said the story in Extremist could be an American story tomorrow. <br/>AM: It already did become an American story, to some extent, while we were shooting and releasing the film, because people are being detained at protests here now too. Of course, it\u2019s different, but still: people are being <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj5nlxz44yo\" target=\"_blank\">detained</a> at protests. And the fear that a group of men in uniform might come and pick you up in the night exists here now as well. That\u2019s why I think our story resonates so much in America. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/407fe499932f4e798a216ff1de7d3ad8a/large\"/><figcaption>Behind the scenes of Extremist. Photo: Molochnikov private archive .</figcaption><br/>NGE: Did you discuss the script with Sasha Skochilenko and her girlfriend Sonya Subbotina? <br/>AM: We discussed it with Sonya first. And then we somehow managed to get the script to Sasha. For me, of course, it was very important and thrilling to get her OK. We wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead without it. <br/>And then something miraculous happened. Sonya and I agreed to do one last call before the shoot, which ended up with me talking to both of them because all of a sudden there was an exchange, and Sasha was released. \u201e <br/>\u201cYou have this idea that a person is out there somewhere, behind bars, and will probably languish there for years, and all of a sudden you\u2019re talking on Zoom!\u201d  <br/>We couldn\u2019t believe it would all happen so quickly. You have this idea that a person is out there somewhere, behind bars, and will probably languish there for years, and all of a sudden you\u2019re talking on Zoom! It was such an incredible feeling. I\u2019ll never forget it. <br/>NGE: Did Sasha give you any clarifications or details that you then used in the film? <br/>AM: Yes, one, but sadly it didn\u2019t make it into the final cut. But maybe we\u2019ll make a director\u2019s cut and add it there. Sasha had this woolly hat with ears. She was wearing it when she went to the store, and they basically identified and found her because of the hat. At one point, the investigator in the case put the hat on and began mocking Sasha. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/e1d3f65e92704193a9f5c265de697913a/large\"/><figcaption>Sasha Skochilenko in court on 14 November 2023. Photo: EPA / ANATOLY MALTSEV.</figcaption><br/>NGE: Is this the investigator Sasha <a href=\"https://savesasha.tilda.ws/yes-life\" target=\"_blank\">mentioned</a> at the trial? The one who resigned before the end of the case? <br/>AM: Yes, him. Artur Smolyaninov plays him in our film. Sadly, that didn\u2019t change anything in Sasha\u2019s case. One resigned, another one came along and she still ended up in prison, but that, of course, only goes to underline her strength and forthrightness. <br/>NGE: What was the most important moment in the Sasha Skochilenko story for you personally? <br/>AM: When she refused to sign a statement that what she wrote on the price tags wasn\u2019t true. <br/>I think replacing the price tags is actually a less important moment in the film than her refusing to back down when the Russian investigators were piling on the pressure. <br/>I\u2019m only talking about the film right now. It\u2019s a really powerful, pretty heroic move, which I wouldn\u2019t be brave enough to have done. But I can imagine doing something like with the price tags, that no one would notice. \u201e <br/>\u201cSasha wasn\u2019t afraid. And that makes her a hero of our time.\u201d  <br/>But if someone said: \u2018Come on, sign this, and say none of it\u2019s true!\u2019 i.e. save yourself, choose. That\u2019s really serious. And I can say for sure that I\u2019d probably have been scared. I think a lot of people would have been. Why sit in a Russian jail for seven years? But Sasha wasn\u2019t afraid. And that makes her a hero of our time. <br/>NGE: Ben Stiller and John Lesher came on board as executive producers. How did that happen and what has it added to the project? <br/>AM: As our film had won the Columbia University festival and then received several other awards, my teacher got in touch with Ben Stiller to say: \u201cHere, watch this movie by my student.\u201d Ben watched it that same day and said: \u201cGive him my number.\u201d After that, we spoke on the phone and had a wonderful discussion about the film. Then we realised the best thing would be for him to be an executive producer and bring his team and his partner John Lesher on board. An <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/11/ben-stiller-john-lesher-oscar-short-extremist-1236614039/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> came out in Deadline, announcing their involvement. We hope to stage a screening and a QA with Stiller soon. <br/>And Stiller\u2019s involvement means more people can hear about the film in the final month before voting for the Oscar shortlist takes place.

No explanation was offered, however, on how exactly King or his novel have violated Russian laws.  <br/>King has long been an outspoken critic of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The American author moved quickly to <a href=\"https://tass.com/society/1426539\" target=\"_blank\">suspend</a> ties with his Russian-language publisher shortly after the war began in early 2022 and routinely <a href=\"https://newsukraine.rbc.ua/news/stephen-king-supports-ukrainians-and-comments-1725282563.html\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a> on the conflict on his X account.  <br/>In July 2022, King was the <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2022/07/21/stephen-king-admits-to-falling-for-russians-prank-fool-me-once-shame-on-them/\" target=\"_blank\">victim</a> of a call by Russian pranksters posing as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky who successfully baited him into praising the controversial Ukrainian Second World War era figure Stepan Bandera, as a \u201cgreat man\u201d.

Ukrainians who have fled but do not wish to see their homes seized are forced to physically return within a short time frame, endure gruelling security checks and a lengthy bureaucratic process, and are subject to intense pressure to obtain a Russian passport, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-ca98fa24-29a3-4c74-aa7d-ce38f756270d\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a>.  <br/>According to legal expert Professor Nehal Bhuta of the University of Edinburgh, such actions are illegal under international law and represent a clear violation of Article 4 of the Geneva Convention, which forbids the seizure of civilian property in war except in limited cases.

Foreign troops on Ukrainian territory would not be permitted, US military aid would be significantly reduced and Kyiv would also be forced to give up a number of strategic weapons that have allowed it to strike deep inside Russia, Axios wrote. <br/>In return, Ukraine and Europe will receive unspecified security guarantees against any future Russian aggression, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-set-talks-turkey-new-peace-drive-2025-11-19/\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a> reported.  <br/>US officials <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/russia-ukraine-war-heacy-attack-ternopil-poland-aircraft-rcna244755\" target=\"_blank\">told</a> NBC News on Wednesday that the plan had President Trump\u2019s support, with one senior administration figure stating that \u201cthe plan focuses on giving both sides security guarantees to secure a lasting peace\u201d.  <br/>The move comes at something of a transitional point in US-Ukrainian relations, with Washington\u2019s special envoy to Kyiv, Keith Kellogg, set to resign in January. Widely viewed as an influential pro-Ukrainian voice in an unpredictable White House, his departure will be a blow to Kyiv at this critical juncture, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trumps-ukraine-envoy-kellogg-leave-post-january-sources-say-2025-11-19/?utm_social_handle_id=114050161948682utm_social_post_id=580375818\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a>.  <br/>Response from Europe has been lukewarm, with the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgdgrqwnq9o\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a> reporting that the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas had urged Ukrainian and European involvement in any deal, while French foreign minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot maintained that \u201cthe Ukrainians do not want any form of capitulation\u201d.

    "summary": "<br/>As Russia sinks ever deeper into its war against Ukraine, hybrid threats against EU countries have intensified. Cyberattacks on airport infrastructure, drone flyovers and violations of airspace by Russian aircraft have become increasingly frequent. With Russian military incursions creeping ever closer, Poland and the Baltic states have assumed the position of Europe\u2019s exposed frontier. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/f931a76e81324ce9858a644b94286595.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Anti-tank fortifications at the Lithuanian border.

These incidents were designed to unsettle rather than inflict real damage, according to Lithuanian military expert Vaidotas Malinionis. <br/>Vladimir Putin is putting on a tough front to appear strong among the domestic elite in light of a lack of clear success in Ukraine, but NATO states \u201cunderstand very well that it\u2019s all a bluff\u201d, Malinionis noted. Putin is trying to show he is attacking NATO \u2014 but it\u2019s more \u201cbrazen behaviour and escalation\u201d than a real attack, with Russian officials publicly denying involvement, he continued. \u201e <br/>Last June, the leaders of Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania called for the construction of a defence line along the EU\u2019s external borders with Russia and Belarus, which has been dubbed the Baltic Defence Line.  <br/>From Malinionis\u2019 perspective, Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare actions produced the opposite results, uniting European nations around defence discussions rather than sowing discord. Harsher responses to airspace violations are now the norm, new defence plans are being drawn up, and resources are being allocated to improve defence capabilities. <br/>Malinionis admits that EU countries were slow to react to the Ukraine invasion, but things are picking up. In Lithuania, a <a href=\"https://www.rheinmetall.com/en/media/news-watch/news/2025/11/2025-11-04-groundbreaking-ceremony-for-munitions-factory-in-lithuania\" target=\"_blank\">Rheinmetall</a> plant for the production of 155mm artillery ammunition is about to commence operations. In any case, Malinionis doesn\u2019t anticipate large-scale Russian attacks in the near future, noting that the country needs three or four years to recover following the end of the Ukraine war \u2014 whenever that may be. <br/>The significance of defence structures and preparedness cannot, however, be underestimated. Poland has built <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/11/14/poland-implements-new-security-measures-at-belarus-border-while-re-opening-two-crossings#:~:text=Poland%20is%20implementing%20additional%20security,metal%20barrier%20at%20the%20border.\" target=\"_blank\">barriers</a> along the Belarusian border.

Photo: Lithuanian army.</figcaption><br/>Last June, the leaders of Poland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/06/27/baltic-states-and-poland-call-on-eu-to-build-defence-line-along-russian-border-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> for the construction of a defence line along the EU\u2019s external borders with Russia and Belarus, which has been dubbed the Baltic Defence Line. But what exactly does it entail? <br/>\u201cIt is a multi-layered system of technical measures and means that includes devices for detection, identification, destruction and deterrence,\u201d says Malinionis. \u201cAnd also offensive capabilities, so that in event, say, of a build-up of forces near NATO borders, we have the capacity to react quickly.\u201d <br/>Some elements of the Baltic Defence Line are visible, such as the \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d which have appeared on the border of Russian exclave Kaliningrad, near the Lithuanian town of Panemun\u0117.  \u201e <br/>Russia has forced the EU\u2019s hand into reallocating substantial resources to its eastern flank \u2014 and Russian threats are now being taken seriously, even if they amount to mere provocations.  <br/>While some have been dubious of the initiative, suggesting that the Nemunas River opposite the Russian city of Sovetsk offers sufficient deterrence, you can never be too careful, Malinionis notes. In case of a ground invasion, Russian troops may set up a pontoon crossing, like they did in 2022 in northern Ukraine as they moved from Belarus towards Kyiv, he says. <br/>The most important thing, in his opinion, has already happened: Russia has forced the EU\u2019s hand into reallocating substantial resources to its eastern flank \u2014 and Russian threats are now being taken seriously, even if they amount to mere provocations. <br/>According to Malinionis, joint operations with Ukraine to counter drone attacks are already underway: they are being studied, monitoring systems and electronic warfare tools are being implemented and mobile units are being deployed. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/41354b1a282a4e75b91fea0dcda73070a/large\"/><figcaption>Fortifications on Lithuania\u2019s border with Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region. Photo: Lithuanian Defence Ministry.</figcaption><br/>A marathon, not a sprint <br/>Lithuania has repeatedly affirmed its plans to increase defence spending to 5-6% of GDP, which sound ambitious. But how realistic is that economically? <br/>\u201cOur country was one of the first in the EU to allocate 2% to defence back in 2019,\u201d Lithuanian economist and MP Jekaterina Rojaka explains. \u201cTo practically double defence spending was a politically difficult decision. But since then, we\u2019ve only raised the bar, and last year we spent 3.11% of GDP.\u201d <br/>Rojaka believes that Lithuania is already implementing a large-scale plan to strengthen defences and does not intend to take any steps backwards. But this will require a \u201crestructuring of priorities\u201d she admits \u201cincluding spending cuts, tax changes and taking out loans\u201d. <br/>In Rojaka\u2019s opinion, the main reserve for increasing defence spending lies in Lithuania\u2019s economic growth, which exceeds the EU average. \u201cIn 2025, GDP growth is expected to reach 2.6%\u20132.8%.\u201d \u201e <br/>Tax increases are inevitable, Rojaka admits, but she insists that defence spending is a direct investment in national security and economic growth.  <br/>The main challenge is that defence spending is projected for the long term: it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint, and Lithuania is relying on external loans. In September, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/2672219/eu-commission-approves-eur6-3-billion-for-lithuania-in-tentative-defence-fund?srsltid=AfmBOoqsmsngDmzWpewTsy9hVoRiFojAi-zczUQ4jFlhiv3vBbzJlFm6\" target=\"_blank\">granted</a> Lithuania more than \u20ac6 billion, using the new Security Action for Europe loan instrument. <br/>Tax increases are inevitable, Rojaka admits, but she insists that defence spending is a direct investment in national security and economic growth. <br/>Sceptics warn, however, that defence spending can lead to negative outcomes, citing the example of Romania in the 1960s\u20131970s, which tried to build a nationwide network of bomb shelters. This led to a rapid rise in debt, and the plan to erect defences never fully came to fruition. <br/>\u201cThat\u2019s why joint European projects are so important,\u201d Rojaka emphasises. \u201cStandardised procurement and financing reduces the debt burden. It also enables us to clearly formulate our goal, and stay within debt and budget deficit limits. It\u2019s difficult, but achievable.\u201d <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/3829836a520b436b89777170aa438947a/large\"/><figcaption>Jekaterina Rojaka. Photo: Augustas Did\u017egalvis / Wikimedia (CC BY-SA 4.0).</figcaption><br/>Preparation is key <br/>Aliaksandr Klachko, a Belarusian who fought for the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2022\u20132023, has real combat experience, having guarded a crossing in Lysychansk and fought in the battles for Bakhmut, both in eastern Ukraine.  <br/>He managed, with great difficulty, to persuade Lithuania to grant him asylum, having to stage a protest outside the central office of the Migration Department. In Belarus, at least 10 politically motivated criminal cases have been opened against him, including for treason and mercenary activity, which is how Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s regime labels his participation in the war on Ukraine\u2019s side.  <br/>When Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began, Ukraine rapidly changed its legislation so that \u201cforeigners who saw the Russian army as an enemy could take up arms,\u201d Klachko explains. \u201cBut in Lithuania, they seem unable to understand who is the enemy and who is a friend.\u201d <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/b8b4251735394d4ea412f74b6fb5469aa/large\"/><figcaption>Aliaksandr Klachko. Photo: Telegram.</figcaption><br/>One of the reasons why the Russian army has failed to capture all of Ukraine, Klachko says, is the country\u2019s vast territory. The Baltic states, however, have \u201cvirtually no chance\u201d without NATO\u2019s protection in case of a Russian invasion, he admits. <br/>However, it still remains up to the people and their willingness to defend their countries, Klachko notes. \u201cNATO will not defend those who surrender without a fight.\u201d <br/>Klachko describes Putin and Lukashenko\u2019s regimes as \u201cstreet thugs who respect only strength\u201d, meaning that they will not attack a \u201cwell-prepared state\u201d and will stop once their victims bite back. Defence preparations, therefore, are key, and EU countries should learn from the lessons of 2022, when they sat around doing nothing for too long, he says. <br/>One of the most critical actions a state should take in the event of large-scale aggression, Klachko says, is evacuation: \u201cUkraine\u2019s experience has shown that war zones are no place for civilians. People should be evacuated quickly and calmly. Several alternative routes should be prepared, including by sea. People should clearly know what to do if, for example, the route to Poland is cut off. If they have a car, they should know where to drive. If they don\u2019t, they should know which station to board a bus or train at.\u201d <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/1036b4768c9a4599a6d6f0edc1a4ff11a/large\"/><figcaption>Military exercises in Vilnius, Lithuania, 2025. Photo: Lithuanian Riflemen\u2019s Union.</figcaption><br/>\u201cDragon\u2019s teeth\u201d, bomb shelters and anti-tank ditches, in his view, are secondary to the need for preparation and knowledge. Once a war becomes prolonged, weapons and technology become more important.  <br/>\u201cWhereas artillery used to be the queen of the battlefield, drones are now the gods of war,\u201d Klachko stresses. \u201cTechnology can prevent personnel losses. Ukraine already uses robotic systems that deliver precision fire, carry out mine-clearing and perform other tasks.\u201d \u201e <br/>Should the protests have succeeded, neither Kyiv nor Vilnius would have had to fear Belarusian involvement in the Russian aggression.  <br/>Klachko adds that Lithuania still has a few years to build a reliable defence system, but that the will to act decisively must be there, mentioning the lack of firm stance taken by Europe or Ukraine in support of Belarus\u2019 2020 protests, which were brutally quashed by Lukashenko\u2019s regime backed by the Kremlin.  <br/>Should the protests have succeeded, neither Kyiv nor Vilnius would have had to fear Belarusian involvement in the Russian aggression, he notes. \u201cBut unfortunately, my country is now occupied, and it happened without a single shot being fired.\u201d <br/>This article was first <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.ee/articles/2025/10/16/za-uslovnoi-stenoi-stoiat-liudi-gotovye-davat-otpor-agressoru-chto-takoe-baltiiskaia-liniia-oborony\">published</a> by Novaya Gazeta Baltic.",

After causing the explosion on the tracks near the town of Mika, they returned to Belarus.

Despite the fact that the sanctions don\u2019t actually take effect until 21 November, buyers appear to have been preemptively spooked. While Russia was shipping around 3.6 million barrels of oil a day in October, this had fallen to 3 million per day within a week of the US announcement of sanctions, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-04/russia-s-crude-deliveries-plunge-as-us-sanctions-begin-to-bite?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to Bloomberg. <br/>Things may be about to get even worse, however, as orders from some of the biggest buyers of Russian oil are already starting to dry up. For example, a group of five Indian oil refineries normally responsible for purchasing around 65% of Russia\u2019s total seaborne crude oil exports has decided to suspend imports for December due to the looming US sanctions. Two Chinese state-owned oil companies, Sinopec and PetroChina, have also cancelled an estimated 45% of all scheduled oil shipments from the port of Kozmino in the Russian Far East. <br/>For now, these cancellations could be said to be a mere temporary pause; a wait-and-see approach to the way that US sanctions play out in the months ahead. Should the suspended orders become more permanent, however, the impact on Kremlin coffers could be substantial, and could lead to the volume of Russian seaborne oil exports dropping to just over 2 million barrels a day, or around 40-45% of what they were prior to last month\u2019s sanctions.  \u201e <br/>The overall picture looks bleak for Russia, and sanctions could eventually reduce Russian oil exports to just 2.8 million barrels a day.  <br/>Moscow does still have its oil pipeline exports to China to fall back on, though, which can top this figure up by around 800,000 to 900,000 barrels a day as, owing to their less transparent nature, pipeline exports are harder to sanction and payment is more likely to be conducted in Chinese yuan or rubles.  <br/>Despite this, the overall picture looks bleak for Russia, and sanctions could eventually reduce Russian oil exports to just 2.8 million barrels a day, a significant drop from the average of 4.8\u20135 million barrels being shipped daily in 2021 and 2022.  <br/>The impact of the recent sanctions has amplified the effect of the so-called \u201cfarewell\u201d sanctions imposed by outgoing US president Joe Biden at the beginning of 2025, which targeted two other major Russian energy exporters, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. An increasing crackdown on the activities of Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d by the European Union, UK and US, has stifled a tactic that had hitherto been used with some success by the Kremlin to circumnavigate sanctions.  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/741e4710383840eb8e7e7b3f05c66b20a/large\"/><figcaption>A freight train at an oil refinery complex in Nizhnekamsk, Tatarstan, 26 July 2017.

In July, Russia was refining around 5.4 million barrels per day, but by the end of October that figure had fallen by around 10%. Ukrainian airstrikes in late October and early November successfully shut down Russia\u2019s largest refineries in the cities of Volgograd, <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/02/six-killed-in-overnight-russian-strikes-on-ukraine-as-kyiv-damages-oil-tanker-and-terminal-in-tuapse-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">Tuapse</a> and Nizhny Novgorod, which, in total, could lead to a 15% fall in refining capacity, equivalent to around 800,000 barrels a day. <br/>Russia\u2019s lack of oil refining capacity is having a knock-on effect on domestic demand and consumption too: gasoline shortages are leading to price increases, yet the lack of spare refining capacity means that oil companies can\u2019t simply refine more oil to produce extra fuel for the Russian market.  \u201e <br/>\u201cNo single strike will kill the system, but a sustained, up-tempo campaign increases the likelihood of cascading failures, longer repairs, and compounding losses of capacity.\u201d  <br/>Experts agree that Ukraine\u2019s consistent focus on exploiting the same Russian vulnerability is finally paying dividends, with Tatyana Mitrova of the Centre for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and Sergey Vakulenko of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/slow-death-russian-oil\" target=\"_blank\">writing</a> a piece called The Slow Death of Russian Oil in Foreign Affairs earlier this month: \u201cNo single strike will kill the system, but a sustained, up-tempo campaign increases the likelihood of cascading failures, longer repairs, and compounding losses of capacity.\u201d <br/>Lukoil\u2019s Volgograd refinery, one of the largest in the country with a production capacity of around 300,000 barrels a day, is a case in point. The facility has been hit no fewer than five times in two months, with the latest attack coming just days after it had been repaired and brought back online, as Mitrova and Vakulenko point out, adding that \u201cthough the repeated attacks have not destroyed the refinery, it has been kept in constant need of repair, stretching spare-parts supply chains that are already constrained by sanctions\u201d. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/fdd377c4187f4f51a398e47f0c392e43a/large\"/><figcaption>A Lukoil gasoline station in St. Petersburg, 23 October 2025.

In absolute terms, the treasury lost revenue worth \u20ac21.3 billion in the first 10 months of this year, just one more reason why the authorities have <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/27/death-and-taxes-en\" target=\"_blank\">increased</a> taxes: expenditure has almost doubled since the pre-war period, and the money has to come from somewhere. <br/>The oil and gas revenue in the budget depends not on the volume of exports, but rather on the volume of oil production. The treasury largely fills its coffers with a mineral extraction tax, which is calculated on the basis of the average export price of Urals crude oil in dollars, the ruble exchange rate and a number of other variables. \u201e <br/>If oil producers have nowhere for their oil to go, budget revenue falls due to a drop in production.   <br/>Therefore, if oil producers have nowhere for their oil to go, budget revenue falls due to a drop in production. The key question now is how long any lull in buying Russian oil will last.  <br/>German economist Janis Kluge, a researcher at the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), believes that the drop in exports will be temporary and Russian oil will find its way back on to the world market soon enough. \u201cBut Rosneft and Lukoil have to rebuild some of their supply chains, maybe also find new business partners or markets, which means lower effective export revenues,\u201d he told Novaya Europe. <br/>But there are two other reasons the budget will be short on tax revenue too. First, the mineral extraction tax will fall as sanctions raise the cost of transporting oil, because, as Kluge says, there is almost no \u201cclean\u201d, i.e. unsanctioned, Urals crude oil on the market. To transport sanctioned oil by sea, Russia would need to grow its \u201cshadow fleet\u201d, which is expensive.  <br/>Secondly, sanctions are increasing the difference in the price between Russian oil and Brent. This year, that has fluctuated between $5 and $7. Kluge thinks that could grow by an additional $10 per barrel and Russian oil could be $15\u2013$17 cheaper than Brent, which was <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/brent-crude-oil\">trading</a> at $64 per barrel on Friday, potentially a huge blow to Russia\u2019s wartime budget. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/7ebaba6c8d304343a70ff498cfc820a8a/large\"/><figcaption>Workers walk in front of railway tankers carrying oil products outside Moscow, Russia, 6 February 2023. Photo: EPA/MAXIM SHIPENKOV.</figcaption><br/>Unknown unknowns <br/>It\u2019s impossible to predict how much the Russian budget will lose, to what extent export revenue will dry up and how far the ruble will fall. Russia sealing its oil wells could lead to an increase in world oil prices. If Russia were to reduce production by 1 million barrels per day, the price of Brent would typically increase by $8\u2013$10 dollars per barrel, Mitrova told Novaya Europe. However, that would only be the case if other suppliers didn\u2019t increase production to compensate for the shortfall. <br/>\u201cSaudi Arabia and the UAE could produce an extra million barrels a day for four to six weeks, but the question is whether they would want to, because if prices rise, they benefit in the short-term,\u201d Mitrova says. However, the US, which abhors expensive gasoline and the inflation that comes with it, could put pressure on producers to increase production, Mitrova continues. <br/>On the other hand, the International Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/iea-raises-2025-oil-supply-forecast-after-opec-output-hike-decision-2025-10-14/\" target=\"_blank\">predicts</a> that the oil surplus will reach 4 million barrels per day in 2026, meaning any reduction in supplies from Russia is unlikely to push up the price of Brent. The main consumers of hydrocarbons are China and the US, and if Trump\u2019s trade wars hit their economies, this would reduce demand for oil. Mitrova says China is currently maintaining global demand by pumping huge amounts into its strategic reserves but that could also end. \u201e <br/>The collapse in revenue from the country\u2019s main export commodity should inevitably lead to a fall in the ruble, a Russian economist told Novaya Europe.  <br/>The reduction in the inflow of petrodollars in the first 10 months of the year has not yet led to a devaluation of the ruble, because the share of foreign trade deals settled in rubles has sharply increased, according to independent investment consultant Andrey Kochetkov, who says that the move away from the dollar and euro has reduced ruble volatility. <br/>However, the collapse in revenue from the country\u2019s main export commodity should inevitably lead to a fall in the ruble, Russian economist Ivan Kuznetsov* told Novaya Europe, adding that he believed the ruble to be overvalued given the tough foreign trade restrictions Russia is under. <br/>If that proves true, devaluation could contribute to a new round of inflation, which has no shortage of other potential causes, such as a shortfall in gasoline and resulting price rises and tax increases. The Central Bank will therefore have to stop cutting interest rates or even start raising them, putting pressure on the civilian economy, in which, unlike the military economy, businesses can very rarely take subsidised or state-guaranteed loans to tide themselves over.  <br/>*name changed",

With two months still unaccounted for, the final figure for 2025 is still likely to rise significantly.  <br/>The leading cause of power outages, accounting for over 40% of cases, remains unspecified infrastructure damage with no official cause. Scheduled maintenance is responsible for 17%, while blackouts caused by extreme weather \u2014 both summer heat and winter cold \u2014 account for 15% of cases.  <br/>As Ukraine considerably scaled up attacks on Russian infrastructure targets in 2025, the share of drone-related power outages rose from 9% to 11%.

Both the missiles reached their targets, as did 32 of the drones, it added. <br/>The State Emergency Service also <a href=\"https://t.me/dsns_telegram/53187\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> fires at energy and port facilities following Russian overnight drone strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, on the Black Sea.  <br/>Oleksiy Kuleba, Ukraine\u2019s minister for communities and territorial development, <a href=\"https://t.me/OleksiiKuleba/7483\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> engineers were working to restore power at one of Odesa\u2019s ports after the strikes, which he said damaged port equipment and several civilian vessels docked nearby. <br/>He added that some 30,000 people had been left without water and some 20,000 people without heating on Monday morning after Russian attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, much of which is occupied by Russian forces. <br/>Ukraine\u2019s Energy Ministry <a href=\"https://t.me/energyofukraine/5338\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> Russia had damaged energy facilities in the Donetsk, Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions overnight, with repair work ongoing on Monday morning. <br/>Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-installed head of what Russia calls the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d, <a href=\"https://t.me/PushilinDenis/8382\" target=\"_blank\">blamed</a> the attacks on the region on Ukrainian forces, and said that the Russian authorities were working to restore power to 500,000 people in the city of Donetsk and the surrounding cities of Makiivka, Horlivka and Yasynuvata. <br/>The strikes came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky landed in Paris, where he is due to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron to finalise a deal on what he <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1989946753085542625\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> a \u201csignificant strengthening\u201d of Ukraine\u2019s air defence capabilities.  <br/>According to Reuters, that deal could include not only the Mirage fighter jets promised by Macron last month, but also more advanced Rafale models.",

Another is borrowing the money at interest, although this is not popular. The third idea, which was proposed by Norwegian economists, is that Norway could use its \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund \u2014 the biggest in the world \u2014 to guarantee the loan. It appears that after a day of discussion, finance ministers backed a proposal from the European Commission to use Russian assets. <br/>The situation on the front has been largely static for months, although Russian forces have been making small gains in some key areas. The battles for the strategically important cities of <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/06/russia-urges-ukrainian-troops-to-surrender-as-battle-for-pokrovsk-enters-critical-phase-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">Pokrovsk</a> in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Huliaipole in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia are a good indication of the progress of the war in general. <br/>It\u2019s hard, amid the flood of disinformation, to accurately monitor from a distance the exact status of these two important battles. Each day brings fresh reports of multiple attacks and advances by Russian troops. There have also been reports that Russian units have captured Pokrovsk. This would be a serious blow for Ukraine, as it\u2019s an important supply hub, with several roads and rail lines converging there. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/3bfd0fe8315d4ddfaf2342afa669a68d.jpeg\"/><figcaption>A Ukrainian serviceman in the frontline city of Kostyantynivka, in eastern Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region, 12 November 2025. Photo: EPA / AFU.</figcaption><br/>But the US-based military think-tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which uses geolocated footage on which to base its assessments, has <a href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-12-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">determined</a> that Russia is not yet in full control of Pokrovsk, having to date seized 46% of the city.  <br/>ISW analysts say Russian military bloggers are \u201cmounting a concerted informational campaign prematurely calling the fall of Pokrovsk, likely to influence the information space\u201d. The battle for Pokrovsk has raged for nearly 18 months now, without resolution \u2014 but with huge casualties on both sides. <br/>Similarly, while the situation in Huliaipole is deteriorating for the Ukrainian defenders, \u201cRussian forces will probably spend considerable time setting conditions for efforts to seize the settlement\u201d, the ISW says. <br/>It\u2019s important to realise that Russian troops initially entered Huliaipole on March 5,2022, within weeks of its initial invasion the previous month, but were quickly pushed back by Ukrainian troops. Fighting has continued in the region ever since. In other words while both sides have made some tactical gains, neither holds the strategic upper hand. <br/>One thing is clear: despite the claims and counter-claims, both sides have suffered significant casualties. In June, the UK Ministry of Defence <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-cost-of-inaction-in-ukraine-is-much-greater-than-the-cost-of-support-uk-statement-to-the-osce\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> more than 1 million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the invasion in February 2022. But Russia still retains considerable reserves of troops to call on, and has not yet had to resort to full mobilisation. <br/>Meanwhile Russia\u2019s economy is holding up, despite western sanctions. The effect of the recent imposition of oil sanctions by the US has yet to be seen. At the same time, Russia\u2019s continuing and thriving diplomatic, economic and military relationships with its \u201cenabler ally\u201d China, as well as others on the anti-Western axis such as Iran and North Korea \u2014 which have been supplying Moscow with weaponry and troops, respectively \u2014 is helping it sustain its offensive efforts. <br/>Ukraine, meanwhile, is now almost entirely reliant on continued western support. Since Donald Trump took power in the US in January, the US stance towards Ukraine has shifted considerably and while Kyiv\u2019s friends in Nato can continue to purchase US weaponry for Ukraine\u2019s war effort, the US will not fund any of the purchases. Consequently, military aid to Ukraine has slowed considerably in the second half of 2025 \u2014 by up to 43% <a href=\"https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/ukraine-support-tracker-military-aid-falls-sharply-despite-new-nato-initiative/\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to German research non-profit the Kiel Institute. <br/>EU leaders voted in October to meet Ukraine\u2019s \u201cpressing financial needs\u201d for another two years and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/eu-weighs-using-russian-assets-or-borrowing-finance-kyiv-2025-11-10/\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> last week to use frozen Russian assets to back its loan. This plan comes with a number of difficulties. These assets are held in Belgium by the securities depository Euroclear. But Brussels is wary of the move, arguing that a Russian lawsuit against the move, if successful, could leave Belgium liable. \u201e <br/><br/>The funds supplied thus far have kept Ukraine from defeat, but have not enabled it to strike a decisive blow against Russia.  <br/>The other obstacle is that it would need to be unanimously approved by EU member states, something that is thought highly unlikely. The idea of using frozen Russian assets has already been rejected by <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/hungary-viktor-orban-russian-assets-sanctions-war-in-ukraine/\" target=\"_blank\">Hungary</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/slovakia-reportedly-wont-back-using-frozen-russian-assets-for-ukraine-military-costs-robert-fico/\" target=\"_blank\">Slovakia</a>. And the recent victory of the populist ANO party in the Czech Republic could signal further isolation for Ukraine. One of the first gestures made by the new Czech government has been to <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/czechia-ukraine-flag-czech-parliament-removal-okamura/33583980.html\" target=\"_blank\">remove</a> the Ukrainian flag from the parliament building. <br/>What impact is this loan likely to make in the grand scheme of things? The funds supplied thus far have kept Ukraine from defeat, but have not enabled it to strike a decisive blow against Russia that would win the war or enable it to negotiate a just peace. <br/>At the same time it is realistic to acknowledge that while a massive injection of funds would help Ukraine stabilise its economy and buy enough arms to give their troops a better chance on the battlefield, it cannot deliver the manpower, weapons or morale. In the end, this latest wave of aid may buy Ukraine time \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely to deliver victory. <br/>This <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kyivs-european-allies-debate-ways-of-keeping-the-cash-flowing-to-ukraine-but-the-picture-on-the-battlefield-is-grim-269541\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> was first published by<a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Conversation</a>.

Photo: Emil Leegunov / Anadolu / Abaca Press / ddp images / Vida Press.</figcaption><br/>As the closest major Russian city to the Ukrainian border, it was perhaps inevitable that Belgorod would become a target for Kyiv\u2019s military retribution, but even the city\u2019s residents hadn\u2019t expected the war to arrive on their doorsteps so quickly. <br/>Within days, Belgorod region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov <a href=\"https://vk.com/wall639631882_455678?reply=456081\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> that the authorities would be unable to afford to fund the reconstruction of all damaged properties, noting that \u201csome people view this as an opportunity for free repairs\u201d and announcing that a family\u2019s income would be taken into account when calculating compensation payments, and that those with \u201chuge houses with big swimming pools\u201d would not qualify for assistance.  <br/>Hearing Gladkov\u2019s remarks, most locals wondered exactly where all these mansions with swimming pools were, and many were outraged by the comments. One angry local <a href=\"https://bel.ru/news/2023-07-25/pridvornyh-net-okna-vybity-belgorodtsy-otvetili-na-zamechanie-o-bogatyh-domah-2993623\" target=\"_blank\">complained</a> to a regional news outlet that she had bought her house with her own hard-earned money. \u201cThe money didn\u2019t fall from the sky, this house is my only home,\u201d she said. <br/>Nevertheless, Gladkov continued his reproach of his constituents, who, he seemed to believe, were attempting to profit from the war. In May, he <a href=\"https://vkvideo.ru/video639631882_456243379?t=48m6s\" target=\"_blank\">accused</a> some people of deliberately parking their cars on the street in the hope of receiving compensation should they be damaged by Ukrainian shelling.  <br/>Asked to provide evidence of such cases, the governor\u2019s office pointed to a single case in which the owner of a car claimed his vehicle had been damaged on three separate occasions and allegedly tried to pass the same marks off as new damage on successive occasions to boost the payout he was due. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/38ca77e146d6438c99d18bf962086f5e.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Belgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov during a meeting with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, 11 July 2025. Photo: EPA / MIKHAIL METZEL / SPUTNIK / KREMLIN.</figcaption><br/>According to the Belgorod authorities, there have also been cases of residents damaging their own roofs in order to qualify for new ones, and one resident apparently tried to pass off an old crack in his house for war damage, while another claimed that shelling had been responsible for his wooden window frames rotting. <br/>Gladkov\u2019s assurances of government-funded repairs gradually dwindled over time, however, with the governor first warning of a shortfall in the budget to pay for housing repairs in January 2023, after one resident whose house close to the Ukrainian border was destroyed in shelling <a href=\"https://bel.ru/news/2023-01-06/belgorodskaya-oblast-zhdyot-federalnuyu-pomosch-dlya-stroitelstva-razrushennyh-domov-2631541\" target=\"_blank\">attempted</a> to apply for funds for its reconstruction.  <br/>Until then, the regional authorities had attempted to restore destroyed or damaged housing stock, however high the cost. In one case, for example, an unlucky home in the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka was damaged six times by shelling, with the Sisyphean task of rebuilding it each time inevitably taking a toll on the regional budget. <br/>\u201cFor 10 months, we covered all costs. But a sharp reduction in the regional budget has made that difficult,\u201d Gladkov <a href=\"https://bel.ru/news/2023-01-06/belgorodskaya-oblast-zhdyot-federalnuyu-pomosch-dlya-stroitelstva-razrushennyh-domov-2631541\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in January 2023, adding that he hoped federal assistance would \u201carrive in the near future\u201d and the necessary work could restart.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/b373a4e997d449fc92ced76bfb4a39b3.jpeg\"/><figcaption>A temporary accommodation centre in Belgorod, western Russia, 1 June 2023. Photo: Picvario Media, LLC / Alamy / Vida Press.</figcaption><br/>About a month later, the federal government did indeed allocate some \u20ac100 million to fund the region\u2019s recovery. A little later, the Belgorod government earmarked a further \u20ac8.5 million of its own funds for reconstruction efforts. <br/>Assistance from the Russian government was a much discussed topic in Belgorod. After a disastrous summer in 2023 in which the town of Shebekino was all but destroyed, Gladkov <a href=\"https://bel.ru/news/2023-07-04/na-vosstanovlenie-domov-v-shebekinskom-okruge-potrebuetsya-poryadka-20-mlrd-rubley-2975068\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that about \u20ac212.5 million would be needed to restore it, adding that he was hoping to get federal assistance for the restoration work. However, when Moscow declined to provide the funds, the regional administration was reportedly forced to take out a loan to pay its contractors. <br/>In January 2024, the chair of Belgorod\u2019s regional Duma, Yury Klepikov, <a href=\"https://belduma.ru/news/detail.php?ID=94026\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a> that some \u20ac87.1 million from the regional budget would be allocated to restoration work over the next three years, and that compensation would also be paid to wounded Belgorod civilians and the relatives of all Belgorod civilians who had been killed in shelling.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/4049b574ff384b9c9717a2165c3eed8d.jpeg\"/><figcaption>A woman sits in front of a burnt-out apartment block in the Belgorod region town of Shebekino, in western Russia, 2 July 2023.

Jagland responded that he was meeting with Lavrov\u2019s assistant the following day and would pass on Epstein\u2019s message, though it is unclear whether anything came of the proposal. <br/>In the email exchange, Epstein also indicated that he had discussed Trump with Vitaly Churkin, who served as Russia's permanent representative to the UN until his death in 2017. \u201cChurkin was great. He understood Trump after our conversations\u201d, Epstein wrote, adding that the US president \u201cmust be seen to get something\u201d in diplomatic negotiations. <br/>Immediately after the controversial Helsinki summit, for which the US president was criticised for dismissing claims of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers contacted Epstein to ask whether \u201cthe Russians have stuff on Trump\u201d as the meeting was \u201cappalling even by his standards\u201d. <br/>\u201cMy email is full with similar comments. Wow\u201d, Epstein replied. \u201cI\u2019m sure his view is that it went super well. He thinks he has charmed his adversary. Admittedly he has no idea of the symbolism. He has no idea of most things\u201d, he continued, calling Trump\u2019s behaviour in the summit \u201cpredictable\u201d. <br/>The email exchange was part of over 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein\u2019s estate released by US lawmakers on Wednesday that shed light on the extent of the disgraced financier\u2019s political connections \u2014 and in which Epstein appears to suggest Trump may have had some knowledge of his wrongdoing. <br/>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats from the House Oversight Committee, who published three of the email exchanges before Republicans responded with a much larger batch, of selectively leaking emails \u201cto the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\u201d. Trump himself labelled the emails a \u201choax\u201d. <br/>Trump\u2019s ties to Moscow have long been a source of public debate, with the US president\u2019s efforts to establish his businesses in Russia reportedly dating back to the 1980s. In 2016, the US intelligence community concluded that Russia had interfered in that year\u2019s presidential election to boost Trump\u2019s campaign.",

    "summary": "<br/>As well as the billions stashed away by Russian oligarchs, the savings of millions of the country's small-scale private investors were frozen by European banks following the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions. These aren\u2019t corrupt government officials or people who appear on the Forbes list, but members of the country\u2019s once burgeoning middle class, many of whom oppose the war and despise Putin.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/0344a8b114fb44779818683847f2d87b.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Zhanna Nemtsova.

Investors from other countries who bought securities through Russian brokers and banks are likewise affected. <br/>The Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom\u2019s <a href=\"https://nemtsovfund.org/en/our-projects/ideas-for-russia/\" target=\"_blank\">Ideas for Russia</a> project and the Social Foresight Group research <a href=\"https://socforesight.com/\" target=\"_blank\">centre</a> have carried out a detailed <a href=\"https://nemtsovfund.org/cp/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CollateralFreezeEN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> of the problem, highlighting those affected by the sanctions. The head of the project, Zhanna Nemtsova, told Novaya Europe\u2019s economic expert Denis Morokhin why she believes it\u2019s wrong to punish people solely for their citizenship. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/34df5bac0cb944499fb51d43e97a1d66a/large\"/><figcaption>A protester holds a banner saying \u2018Putin is a killer\u2019 at a rally outside the Russian Embassy in Riga, Latvia, 17 March 2024. Photo: Toms Kalnins / EPA.</figcaption><br/>DM: I want to ask you first of all to identify the problem. Which assets are we talking about being frozen here? <br/>ZN: It\u2019s important to understand that we are not talking about sanctioned oligarchs or billionaires who are great at defending their interests and fighting sanctions in courts. <br/>There are three groups of assets that have been blocked since the start of the war. First and foremost, these are Russian sovereign assets frozen after Europe, the US and others imposed sanctions. Various estimates put their value at $280 billion to $330 billion.  <br/>The second group are the accounts, real estate and investments of sanctioned Russian individuals: oligarchs, officials, managers of state-owned companies. \u201e <br/>\u201cThe Central Bank of Russia only provides ballpark estimates of how many people are affected by the freeze.\u201d  <br/>And the third, and largest group, are the private assets frozen due to sanctions on Russian financial bodies, such as the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange or brokers and banks through which Russian citizens bought foreign securities. There is a lot we don\u2019t know about these assets. Some probably belong to sanctioned persons, possibly through companies.  <br/>But there are others owned by those who have not been sanctioned, who most likely form the vast majority of individuals who own the frozen assets. The Central Bank of Russia only provides ballpark estimates of how many people are affected by the freeze. It\u2019s important to understand which private investors are not under sanctions. As things stand, we are a long way from understanding the scale and structure of the problem. But, based on our analysis, we can say that small- to medium-sized assets owned by those without large incomes are the ones that have been frozen most often. <br/>\u2018A huge blow to the Russian middle class\u2019 <br/>DM: What motivated you to take on this topic in the first place?  <br/>ZN: I stumbled across the topic quite by chance. I met people from the Russian-speaking business community in Europe. A wide range of people got together to discuss different ideas, when one participant said that huge funds belonging to individuals were frozen in the European Union. I hadn\u2019t heard anything about that before so I asked for a little more detail. This businessman and I spoke on the phone.  <br/>DM: Did you decide to tackle frozen assets because of the scale of the problem? <br/>ZN: I decided to because it\u2019s such a huge blow to the Russian middle class, and a serious blow to the anti-war community, since our online survey of victims showed that about 40% of them no longer live in Russia, having left at the beginning of the war, mainly for the EU. <br/>Different restrictions, such as visa difficulties, get discussed much more often, but frozen assets are no less widespread as a problem. In fact, they\u2019re the most massive sanction Russians face, and affect the most progressive section of Russian society, and citizens of other countries \u2014 clients of the Russian financial system. <br/>It doesn\u2019t help Ukraine and doesn\u2019t undermine the foundations of the Putin regime. Moreover, it goes against the principle that private property is inviolable and cannot be seized without a good reason and or a court order. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/247cd44a10374add8f00b280b592a830a/large\"/><figcaption>An anti-war march by Russians in Berlin, Germany, 1 March 2025. Photo: Vasily Krestyaninov / Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>Everyone\u2019s a winner <br/>DM: So tell me what you propose to do. <br/>ZN: First we need to conduct an inventory of assets and gather the most detailed information possible on all their end beneficiaries. I would then also create a very simple online system where you can register as an unsanctioned private investor whose assets have been frozen. This wouldn\u2019t be difficult, but it would require the approval of the European financial authorities and regulators. This would help us calculate how many unsanctioned Russians had lost access to their savings. <br/>DM: What\u2019s the next step? <br/>ZN: If the European financial authorities conduct an inventory and identify Russians who aren\u2019t under sanctions, then, according to existing EU legislation, their assets can be unfrozen. Remember, we are talking about Russians resident in the European Union who have bank accounts there. The unfreezing process itself should be simple, and the EU could take a commission for reviewing the application and going through the documents, which it could then direct towards goals it deemed necessary and important, such as supporting Ukraine. <br/>DM: Will this require changes to national legislation in various European countries, or can everything be done at EU level? <br/>ZN: I think this can be solved via European Commission directives. <br/>DM: So that covers Russians who have left Russia. But what about those who have stayed behind? <br/>ZN: For them, sadly, it\u2019s impossible to unfreeze assets as long as sanctions remain in place. We can act only within the framework of the sanctions regime, which has led to all ties between European and Russian financial institutions being cut. They would have to leave Russia to unfreeze their investments.  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/3035c92669724a489baf4fb7900103cca/large\"/><figcaption>A man protests at the Russian Embassy in Riga, Latvia, 17 March 2024. Photo: EPA / TOMS KALNINS.</figcaption><br/>For Europe, not Putin <br/>DM: You\u2019ll definitely hear people say that given Russia attacked Ukraine, it would be inappropriate to lift financial sanctions on Russians. Do you have a counter-argument? <br/>ZN: I believe protecting private property is key. Putinism was originally built on the belief that only those loyal to the president should be able to own large assets. This is very dangerous. <br/>I see nothing as more important for democracy and the protection of free speech and other freedoms than the protection of private property. It\u2019s very important to say it out loud, because it has been forgotten. <br/>DM: Does this campaign mark your entry into politics? <br/>ZN: No. I have a very narrow definition of politics. Politics means fighting for power, contesting elections. Whereas I head the Nemtsov Foundation. This is a public advocacy campaign, a public interest campaign with a political dimension. \u201e <br/>\u201cI\u2019m a pragmatist. The Russians who have left the country are talented and smart. They can either be a useless burden or of great benefit to the European Union.\u201d  <br/>DM: Does it feel to you right now that even more Russians in the EU are currently having their bank accounts closed, struggling to gain residence permits, and so on? <br/>ZN: Yes, unfortunately, until the war stops, it looks like people with Russian roots will periodically face knockbacks on all sides. The trouble is, these sanctions on Russians don\u2019t solve a single problem. Massive sanctions on people with Russian passports won\u2019t stop the war. <br/>But there are other sanctions worse than closing people\u2019s accounts. There is an EU regulation that says that if you are a Russian citizen, even if you have an EU citizenship or residence permit, you cannot bid for state contracts being put out to tender. The same applies to companies with over 50% Russian ownership, even if said owners also have European citizenship or a residence permit. That\u2019s to say, you can only bid for state projects if you renounce your Russian citizenship.  <br/>If you have a company in Europe and you own technology that the European Union needs, European government customers cannot use it. It\u2019s absurd. I\u2019m a pragmatist. The Russians who have left the country are talented and smart. They can either be a useless burden or of great benefit to the European Union.",

Kommersant blamed the falling price for Urals crude oil and a stronger ruble. Only March, August and September witnessed a budget surplus so far this year.  <br/>Russian oil prices have<a href=\"https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8194584?from=top_main_3\"> sunk</a> to their lowest level since the beginning of the year, according to Kommersant, with oil at ports in the Baltic and Black Sea selling for almost $20 per barrel lower than the price of Brent crude oil since the US <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/23/us-sanctions-rosneft-and-lukoil-after-trump-cancels-budapest-summit-with-putin-en-news\">imposed</a> sanctions on Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft at the end of October. <br/>A statement on the US Treasury Department website said that its imposition of sanctions came \u201cas a result of Russia\u2019s lack of serious commitment to a peace process to end the war in Ukraine\u201d and aimed to \u201cdegrade the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise revenue for its war machine and support its weakened economy\u201d. <br/>The price for Urals crude oil was $19.4 cheaper per barrel than benchmark Brent crude on 10 November, Kommersant continued, while in early November, the discount was equivalent to $13\u201314 per barrel, and just $11\u201312 prior to October\u2019s sanctions. However, according to experts who spoke to Kommersant, Russian oil prices are likely to return to levels seen in early autumn once the market has stabilised. <br/>In further signs of a slowdown in the Russian economy, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) <a href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-november-10-2025/\">reported</a> on Monday that German Gref, the head of Russia\u2019s Sberbank, had told Vladimir Putin that the bank was experiencing only \u201cvery modest\u201d growth due to \u201cchallenging macroeconomic conditions\u201d, with growth this year being worse than expected.

Russia commands far more resources than Ukraine does, and Westerners have too often underestimated the Russian army\u2019s adaptability. The country still has a massive capacity to produce (and import) attack drones and mobilise military investment at a rate <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/how-russia-recovered\" id=\"wj5zw1jp6\" target=\"_blank\">double</a> that of the West in Ukraine. That means it can maintain a manpower and an equipment edge despite its massive losses. The civilian economy may be stagnant, but the military machine is running at full speed.  <br/>But even if we are willing to admit that there will be no military solution, because neither Ukraine nor Russia can win the war, we must ask how the bloodletting can be stopped. One way is for the West to increase its support for Ukraine while doing more to break the back of Russia\u2019s war economy, namely by doing what it takes to cut off its hydrocarbon exports. This is not a simple matter: the European Union\u2019s energy imports from Russia in 2024 <a href=\"https://energyandcleanair.org/publications/?_publication_search=eu+energy+imports+from+russia\" id=\"j03lrlags\" target=\"_blank\">exceeded</a> its annual aid to Ukraine.  <br/>To force a reckoning that might end the fighting, it would seem that Europe needs US President Donald Trump\u2019s help. The United States would have to provide Ukraine with the capability to strike targets deep inside Russia, just as Russia has been doing to Ukraine. The US would also need to seize frozen Russian financial assets that are under its jurisdiction and send them to Ukraine. <br/>Then, the US and the EU would need to impose secondary sanctions on the main buyers of Russian hydrocarbons: India, China, and Turkey. Well-designed secondary sanctions have been the best weapons deployed against Russia\u2019s war economy so far, and harsh measures targeting its energy sector could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. <br/>But Trump has shown no serious interest in pursuing these options. The 50% tariff that he slapped on India was not really related to its purchases of Russian oil; rather, it is a ploy to extract concessions from India\u2019s government. Once those are obtained, Trump may well drop the 50% levy. <br/>As for China, the uncertainty is even greater. Having just announced a trade armistice with China, Trump is unlikely to risk antagonising it over Ukraine \u2014 a country that he cares nothing about. Moreover, if Trump were to ask Chinese President Xi Jinping to intercede with Putin, what would Xi ask for in exchange?  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/122f984f81ed4f41898c56da138cd389a/large\"/><figcaption>Ukrainian servicemen carry the coffins of 12 soldiers who died in Russian captivity through the streets of Lviv, western Ukraine, 25 July 2025. Photo: EPA / Mykola Tys.</figcaption><br/>He would probably propose an arrangement in which Ukraine is neutralised as a perceived threat to Russia, which would threaten European interests, not to mention Ukrainian sovereignty. Since this would be in line with the spheres-of-influence diplomacy that Xi, Putin, and Trump all embrace, Trump would probably jump at it. <br/>Whereas former US president Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy sought to preserve American primacy in the world, Trump <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA4107-1.html\" id=\"vo7eoaaqy\" target=\"_blank\">seems</a> more open to co-managing things with the Chinese, even going so far as to refer to the Sino-American relationship as the G2. But even with all the benefits that would accrue to China in a carved-up world, Xi would not bring Putin on board for free. On the contrary, he would want the US to state openly that Taiwan is not and never will be an independent state. <br/>Since January 2025, Putin has managed to buy time by manipulating the easily manipulated Trump. This approach is now reaching its limits, however, simply because Trump has failed to extract any concession from Putin that would allow him to claim, however implausibly, a formal diplomatic victory. Still, Trump is not seeking Russia\u2019s defeat, and though he may finally be putting a little more pressure on Putin, it is not the kind that would ever make Putin buckle. But China can push Putin toward a compromise.  \u201e <br/>Europe alone cannot reverse the tide unless it bets on a Russian collapse, which is far from certain.   <br/>What could this look like? Sadly, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen lacks the competence to meet with Xi as an equal; European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa is too self-effacing; and the new EU chief diplomat, former Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas, appears to be too weak to take the lead. <br/>It is therefore up to leading member states \u2014 France, Germany, and Poland (given its proximity to Russia and Ukraine) \u2014 to act. Dialogue with the Kremlin must happen, too, whether Europeans like it or not. Europe alone cannot reverse the tide unless it bets on a Russian collapse, which is far from certain.  <br/>Of course, what is true today will not necessarily be true tomorrow. Everything is a matter of the balance of power, not of clear-cut principles. Europe, which is enduring many hardships, has no interest in an endless war in Ukraine. But it does have interests there, and it cannot afford to agree to a settlement that ignores them.  <br/>This <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ukraine-war-europe-should-cut-out-trump-talk-to-china-and-kremlin-by-zaki-laidi-2025-11\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> was first published by <a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Syndicate</a>.

    "summary": "<br/>Though it may stop short of creating a one-party state in the South Caucasus, Georgian Dream has begun the process of banning its three biggest political rivals on the grounds that they pose a threat to its democratic mandate, an incredible step for a country that less than two years ago was granted EU candidate status.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/9aa97254ac944f0689fafc787d698f4a.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Police use water cannons and tear gas to disperse protesters in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi, Georgia, 29 November 2024. Photo: EPA / David Mdzinarishvili .</figcaption><br/>While the opposition will fight the ruling party\u2019s attempt to ban their activities through legal channels, and has pledged to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary, even that may prove to be a dead end as frustrated politicians in the European establishment have begun calling for Georgia\u2019s suspension or even expulsion from the Council of Europe over its democratic backsliding. <br/>The big three <br/>Georgian Dream, the political juggernaut created by shadowy billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili that has run the country since 2012, first <a href=\"https://civil.ge/archives/621492\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it would ban its political opponents last year. Though the decision drew strong criticism from the West, whose active support for the Georgian government coupled with significant financial largesse were both rapidly withdrawn, Georgian Dream has stuck to its guns and on 28 October submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court signed by 88 of its deputies, demanding it ban the party\u2019s opponents for their supposedly \u201cunconstitutional\u201d activities. <br/>Though it had initially threatened to ban all pro-Western forces, Georgian Dream ultimately submitted a list of the country\u2019s three most popular opposition parties to the Constitutional Court \u2014 the United National Movement (UNM), the former ruling party that was founded by jailed former president Mikheil Saakashvili; the Coalition for Change, created by politicians who split from the UNM; and Lelo for Georgia, which is led by Mamuka Khazaradze, the founder of TBC, one of Georgia\u2019s largest commercial banks. <br/>In addition to banning the parties themselves, Georgian Dream\u2019s legal filing to the Constitutional Court provides for restrictions on the public activity of specific politicians representing those parties. Announcing that the government was no longer applying for a blanket ban on the opposition, the speaker of the Georgian Parliament, Shalva Papuashvili, explained that the remaining opposition parties were not popular enough to pose a threat to Georgian Dream, though he added that they could always be added to the list at a later stage if necessary.  <br/>The arguments used by Georgian Dream to vilify the country\u2019s entire opposition echo those it has used for years against former president Mikheil Saakashvili, who has been in prison on a litany of <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/06/georgias-former-president-to-face-fresh-charges-for-sabotage-and-inciting-coup-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">charges</a> including embezzlement since 2021.  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/5919c60d8dc24b6f87eb41406c85b183a/large\"/><figcaption>Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili during his trial in Tbilisi, Georgia, 2 December 2021. Photo: EPA/Irakli Gedenidze.</figcaption><br/>The government accuses the opposition of undermining \u201cthe peaceful restoration of Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity and attempting to provoke active military actions between Georgia and Russia,\u201d as well as \u201cthe attempted overthrow and violent replacement of Georgia\u2019s constitutional order and assistance to a foreign power in violating Georgia\u2019s independence,\u201d the latter being a reference to the events of 4 October, when a group of protesters <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/05/anti-government-protests-in-tbilisi-lead-to-attempted-storming-of-georgia-s-presidential-palace-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">broke</a> through a fence and entered the courtyard of the Georgian president\u2019s residence, leading the authorities to open a criminal case for an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that saw several dozen protesters detained. <br/>Following Georgian Dream\u2019s contested <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/10/27/georgias-ruling-party-named-winner-in-pivotal-election-that-opposition-says-was-stolen-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">victory</a> in last year\u2019s parliamentary elections, one of the very first things the new parliament did was establish a commission \u2014 which it described as an equivalent to the Nuremberg trials \u2014 to investigate the alleged misdeeds of Saakashvili's UNM government, which ran Georgia from 2004 to 2012. <br/>This summer, six opposition leaders: Nika Gvaramia, Nika Melia, Zurab Japaridze, Giorgi Vashadze, Mamuka Khazaradze, and Badri Japaridze, were sentenced to six months in prison for their refusal to testify before the commission, though Khazaradze and Japaridze were pardoned by Georgian President Mikheil Kavelashvili after their party, Lelo for Georgia, agreed to take part in local elections in early October that were being boycotted by the rest of the opposition. \u201e <br/><br/>\u201cThis was not an adventure and not stupidity, but precisely a chronicle of betrayal.\u201d  <br/>The commission blamed Saakashvili\u2019s government for provoking Georgia\u2019s 2008 war with Russia, which it said had damaged Georgia\u2019s \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d, as it saw 111 additional settlements in South Ossetia come under Russian control, as well as the Kodori gorge in Abkhazia. \u201cThis was not an adventure and not stupidity, but precisely a chronicle of betrayal,\u201d said Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. <br/>Party\u2019s over <br/>Georgian Dream ran its entire 2024 election campaign on the importance of it winning a big enough majority in parliament to allow it to amend the constitution, for which it required at least 113 of the 150 seats. However, it only managed to secure a total of 89. <br/>Since Georgian Dream so successfully ruined its relationship with the European Union in the run up to the elections, the independent media have increasingly voiced concerns that the real reason the party is so fixated on winning enough seats to amend the constitution is to remove Article 78, which obliges the state to spare no effort in pursuing membership of European structures. <br/>Opposition media are actively discussing a scenario in which, after eliminating its main competitors, Georgian Dream could claim that it had responded to the demands of the Georgian public and to the advice of its Western partners to call early elections, in which, with its main rivals out of the picture, it could easily secure a constitutional majority. <br/>Most Georgian Dream deputies who continue to speak to journalists have said that the removal of the constitutional requirement to join the EU and NATO is not even under consideration within the party, and that the country is still committed to joining the EU, albeit only \u201cwhile preserving its dignity\u201d. The same deputies also claim that there has been no discussion of early elections and insist that Georgian Dream is not afraid of its political rivals. However, any decision to call an early election is unlikely to be made by rank-and-file deputies. <br/>Several other Georgian Dream luminaries including Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze have disingenuously made the argument that European darlings Ukraine and Moldova have banned certain opposition parties, despite the fact that the ban only applies to extremists that espouse violence, advocate hatred and call for the overthrow of the government.  <br/>To Strasbourg? <br/>Georgia\u2019s Constitutional Court, which convenes in the country\u2019s second city Batumi, is expected to take nine months to consider the ruling party\u2019s application, and though the opposition has no confidence in the objectivity of the judges, its politicians nevertheless intend to take an active role in the process.  <br/>One of the leaders of the Coalition for Change, Nika Gvaramia, believes that the number of parties in the lawsuit was reduced to three to speed up the proceedings; otherwise, he says, it could take the court years to question representatives of each one.  <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/804fa2197252464898b8b6024185f16ca/large\"/><figcaption>Protestors clash with riot police during a protest against the \u201cforeign agents\u201d law in Tbilisi, Georgia, 1 May 2024. Photo: EPA / David Mzdinarishvili.</figcaption><br/>Members of the Lelo for Georgia party have also pledged to travel to Batumi as frequently as necessary to fight Georgian Dream\u2019s ban, and it has also filed its own countermotion demanding that the court declare the government\u2019s proposed ban on its biggest opponents unconstitutional. <br/>Meanwhile, Saakashvili\u2019s UNM believes that recourse to Strasbourg is its only real hope. \u201cEveryone knows that the Constitutional Court decides nothing and cannot deliver impartial justice. Georgian Dream has managed to gain full control over even the court\u2019s composition, except for two judges,\u201d says one of its leaders Levan Bezhashvili, who adds that the European Court of Human Rights \u201cclearly supports us\u201d.  <br/>According to him, \u201cGeorgian Dream has failed to kill the idea of the National Movement, the idea of patriotism, the idea of a successful Georgian state, a European Georgia. And when they could not rid themselves of these ideals through elections, they were forced to introduce brutal constitutional amendments in the Russian style.\u201d \u201e <br/><br/>\u201cThe banning of the democratic opposition would, in practice, lead to the establishment of a one-party dictatorship.\u201d  <br/>With such an approach, Georgia will not only be denied membership of the European Union but could also face being suspended or even expelled from the Council of Europe, according to its co-rapporteurs for Georgia, Edite Estrela and Sabina \u0106udi\u0107. <br/>Noting Georgia\u2019s \u201crapid democratic backsliding\u201d, the Council of Europe co-rapporteurs have warned that \u201cthe banning of the democratic opposition would, in practice, lead to the establishment of a one-party dictatorship and would be incompatible with membership in the Council of Europe.\u201d  <br/>\u201cIf Moldova has shown in its parliamentary elections that Europe can defeat Russia, and Ukraine proves every day that Europe is worth fighting for, Georgia, once the leading country of the Associated Trio, has turned into a one-party dictatorship, straying from the path of European integration and falling into Putin\u2019s embrace,\u201d UNM chair Tina Bokuchava said at the EU Eastern Partnership Parliamentary Assembly in Yerevan, Armenia, on 29 October, accusing Georgian Dream of refusing \u201cto hear the truth\u201d. As if to illustrate her point, Georgian Dream\u2019s own delegation of MPs to the assembly declined to attend the session.",

    "summary": "<br/>Despite being in prison, activist and journalist Olga Komleva is still well-thought of in her home town of Ufa, the capital of Bashkortostan, a republic in Russia\u2019s central Volga region. A former volunteer for Alexey Navalny\u2019s team who arranged protests and worked as an election monitor, she is perhaps best known for her work reporting on the mass arrests of demonstrators that followed the trial and conviction of Bashkir activist Fail Alsynov in 2024.   <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/ec0e2c06bf5447eea77484be84921c2f.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Olga Komleva during the Baymak protests in Bashkortostan, January 2024. Photo: Telegram / Komleva.</figcaption><br/>After being charged with 18 offences, and told to repay some 5 million rubles (\u20ac53,300) to cover the costs of policing unsanctioned pro-Navalny protests in Ufa, Komleva was eventually tried for charges of extremism and spreading disinformation about the Russian army and sentenced to 12 years in a penal colony. She has since served 18 months in multiple detention facilities, where, due to her poor treatment, she has gone mute.  <br/>Unspeakable <br/>Bashkortostan\u2019s Supreme Court had been due to hear Komleva\u2019s appeal against her sentence on 28 October, but the hearing was <a href=\"https://t.me/rusnews/76294\" target=\"_blank\">rescheduled</a> without any official explanation. A possible explanation could have been Komleva\u2019s condition, as she had been unable to speak due to stress for six weeks. Olga and her husband, Vyacheslav, submitted a note to the court asking that they take her condition into account.  <br/>According to Komleva, she has been <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/21/jailed-russian-journalist-can-no-longer-speak-after-assaults-by-prison-staff-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">unable</a> to speak since 8 September. \u201cI hope my voice comes back at some point; I\u2019ve only been able to make a few involuntary sounds a couple of times, but when I try to speak nothing comes out.\u201d <br/>Komleva has so far spent five months in two Moscow pretrial detention centres and seven months in one in Ufa itself. She is currently serving her sentence in the town of Dyurtyuli, an hour and a half\u2019s drive from the regional capital. <br/>This is not the first time something like this has happened to her, though. She first went mute during the pandemic in 2020, then again the following year after she was arrested at a protest in Ufa. Then, when she was arrested again on extremism charges in December 2024. <br/>Earlier this year, Olga was subjected to a particularly invasive search in her pretrial detention centre in Ufa, which she says verged on harassment, accusing the female prison guard of inappropriately touching her breasts and buttocks several times.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/85ee18d178854b3985a06d936f7ac4bd.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Olga Komleva in 2022. Photo: olgakomleva2 / X.</figcaption><br/>Komleva <a href=\"https://t.me/OlgaKomlewa/538\" target=\"_blank\">made</a> an official complaint to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, and found herself unable to speak again. A similar incident occurred after she was moved to her fifth detention centre. \u201cOlga has some kind of neurological condition. When she experiences particularly strong emotions she tends to faint,\u201d her husband Vyacheslav says.  <br/>\u201cIn everyday life, she can cope with this quite effectively. In Dyurtyuli, to the best of my knowledge, nothing happened that could be construed as harassment. The search simply reminded her of what had happened in Ufa, and how certain liberties were taken.\u201d  <br/>According to Vyacheslav, his wife\u2019s conditions are currently satisfactory, or at least, as good as they can be for somebody with Type II diabetes in a Russian prison colony. He says that he regularly sends her medicine and diabetic-friendly food, so that she can at least manage her blood sugar levels.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/57cf8260a652466088683c2dce3a2660.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Olga Komleva in court in Ufa, Bashkortostan, on 29 July. Photo: SOTAvision.</figcaption><br/>Komleva is currently being held in solitary confinement in Dyurtyuli, which means that she has an abundance of free time on her hands, which she spends reading and drawing. She has also begun learning Korean. Her letters from prison are often accompanied with sketches.  <br/>\u201cOne of the most difficult things about being in a detention facility is not being alone with your thoughts. If you don\u2019t find something to occupy yourself with, over time your doubts start to eat away at you and you begin to spiral. You can end up in a very dark place mentally,\u201d she wrote to her supporters. <br/>A record fee  <br/>Before her arrest, Komleva had also been involved in activism for many years, passionately campaigning on environmental issues. In 2017, abnormal levels of radioactivity were detected in Ufa\u2019s rainwater, which ecologists <a href=\"https://www.idelreal.org/a/ruteniy-106-opasnost-ugroza-radiatsiya/28872331.html\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> were likely due to emissions of the isotope Ruthenium-106 from the Mayak Production Association, one of Russia\u2019s largest nuclear facilities, in the neighbouring Chelyabinsk region.  <br/>Komleva successfully campaigned for the Prosecutor\u2019s General\u2019s Office to investigate the officials accused of covering the incident up, though, despite the case going to court, no convictions were ultimately secured. <br/>As a journalist for independent media outlet RusNews, Komleva reported widely on the legal consequences Ufa residents faced for mounting any form of political protest. In particular, she focused on those who took part in demonstrations against the 2024 <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/01/18/rotting-from-the-head-en\" target=\"_blank\">conviction</a> of Bashkir activist Fail Alsynov.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/d693c00ab14e45699c46299461b8e480.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Riot police face off with demonstrators in Ufa, Bashkortostan, 19 January 2024. Photo: SOTAvision.</figcaption><br/>Alsynov was sentenced to four years in prison on obviously trumped-up charges of inciting ethnic hatred over comments he made during a public appearance that appear to have been mistranslated from his native Bashkir into Russian. His conviction sparked some of the biggest <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/01/19/bashkortostan-protests-in-support-of-convicted-activist-spread-to-capital-ufa-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrations</a> in Russia since the war in Ukraine began and led to the arrest of at least 75 activists. <br/>Komleva continued to play an active role in local politics, working as an election observer and attending demonstrations and rallies. When the Navalny Centre opened in Ufa in March 2017, its director Lilia Chanysheva asked Komleva if she would volunteer there. <br/>\u201cOlga did that because she thought something had to change,\u201d Komlev says of his wife\u2019s involvement with the Navalny campaign: \u201cOf course, she never intended to stage any revolutions \u2014 she is against violence of any kind and she has always acted according to this conviction.\u201d  <br/>More protests later followed, after which Komleva\u2019s home was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KomlevaOlgaUfa/posts/1045598012498549?comment_id=1045610159164001reply_comment_id=1045610465830637notif_id=1571138469509820notif_t=feed_comment_reply\" target=\"_blank\">searched</a>, along with those of Navalny staff members in 30 other cities, in 2019. \u201cOlga wasn\u2019t especially worried about being arrested,\u201d says Komlev. \u201cThey arrested her again and again, but only the first time really left an impression.\u201d \u201e <br/><br/>\u201cWe have got used to it. They have persecuted us in so many ways that they\u2019ve run out of options.\u201d  <br/>In January and April 2021, Komleva was again arrested and charged with \u201cusing social media to organise unauthorised demonstrations\u201d on the eve of large pro-Navalny demonstrations. A record 18 lawsuits were filed in total, with the authorities demanding that Komleva cover the costs of policing the demonstrations which took place on 23 and 31 January 2021.  <br/>They also sought reimbursement for fuel costs, with the total sum coming to 5.6 million rubles (\u20ac60,000). Though she managed to pay part of the bill by asking her supporters to donate money, Komleva nevertheless had all her property confiscated and her bank accounts frozen.  <br/>\u201cThese lawsuits are still only partially paid off. We, of course, challenged them in the court of appeal, but unsuccessfully,\u201d her husband told us. \u201cThe remainder to be paid is around 4 million rubles (\u20ac42,700). All of Olga\u2019s shares in our property have been seized, but this hasn\u2019t made things too uncomfortable. We have got used to it. They have persecuted us in so many ways that they\u2019ve run out of options.\u201d <br/>The trial <br/>In June 2021 a Moscow court ruled both Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and his political team to be \u201cextremist organisations\", which led to the employees of both groups being arrested and charged with extremist activity. Lilia Chanysheva was arrested in 2023 and sentenced to seven and a half years in a penal colony, which the court later extended to nine and a half years. Having witnessed Chanysheva\u2019s case, Komleva <a href=\"https://t.me/OlgaKomlewa/366\" target=\"_blank\">predicted</a> that she would likely become the state\u2019s top target in Ufa.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/031c031e94f54f408f4e00d4156156b0.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Lilia Chanysheva in court in Ufa, 13 June 2023. Photo: SOTA.</figcaption><br/>On 27 March 2024 Komleva was taken in for questioning over her own links to the FBK. At first she was treated as a witness, but she was rapidly reclassified as a suspect and placed in pretrial detention. A few months later, Komleva had a fresh charge of spreading disinformation about the Russian army added to her docket, before having her name added to the Russian government\u2019s register of terrorists and extremists in August 2024. <br/>Komleva was only given two days to acquaint herself with the details of her case, and as her trial was conducted behind closed doors, little is known of the specifics. Komleva\u2019s former lawyer Mikhail Lavrentyev has claimed that \u201cthere were no specifics, because the investigation provided no evidence,\u201d and that the case \u201cfollowed Lilia Chanysheva\u2019s example closely\u201d.  <br/>The Prosecutor General\u2019s Office requested a sentence of 13 years \u2014 she was ultimately <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/07/29/russian-journalist-sentenced-to-12-years-in-prison-for-navalny-ties-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">given</a> 12. Undeterred, Komleva wrote the following on her Telegram channel. \u201cA 12-year sentence is no reason to give up. Dozens of court cases have gone against me in my life. My soul is already full, so I just carry on without feeling.\u201d \u201e <br/><br/>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything from the appeal, but there is still hope that her case will be reconsidered.\u201d  <br/>Komleva had expected a shorter sentence than Chanysheva \u201cbecause I know for a fact that Olga didn\u2019t actually do anything illegal,\u201d her husband says. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything from the appeal, but there is still hope that her case will be reconsidered. Everything was so haphazard and so riddled with contradictions that essentially every rule was broken, both procedurally and in terms of the facts of the case.\u201d <br/>In November 2023, the European Court of Human Rights awarded Komleva \u20ac4,500 in damages from the Russian state for her 2018 imprisonment, followed by another award of \u20ac6,000 the following year. Two more cases her lawyers have brought against the Russian state are currently under review in Strasbourg, and Komleva has been declared a political prisoner by the Nobel-Prize-winning human rights group Memorial.  <br/>\u201cOlga has many supporters,\u201d says her husband. \u201cThey write to her, and even approach me on the street to pass on their good wishes. Generally speaking, her arrest and trial has harmed the authorities more than it has her. Pensioners, our neighbours and acquaintances all say that was a lawless act. Maybe some of them have even been inspired to think more critically about what is going on in Russia as a result of her case.\u201d <br/>This article by Yulia Paramanova was first <a href=\"https://veter.info/posts/FtK7hwDQYHbM\">published</a> in Russian by media outlet Veter.

The party had been going for several hours before riot police officers arrived and put an abrupt end to proceedings. Police spent over two hours searching attendees and checked 17 rooms on the premises before allowing people to leave, Baza said.  <br/>Eyewitnesses said that the police ordered party-goers not to film the raid and demanded that any footage already taken be deleted, according to Ostorozhno Novosti. The police came after receiving an anonymous tip-off that the law banning so-called \u201dLGBT propaganda\u201d was being broken, Baza said. <br/>Last month, Moscow police <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/19/police-raid-kissing-party-at-moscow-club-in-fresh-crackdown-on-nightlife-venues-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">raided</a> a self-styled \u201ckissing party\u201d at a nightclub in the eastern part of the Russian capital in another instance of the authorities cracking down on what they deem to be \u201cnon-traditional\u201d events. The city\u2019s once world-famous nightlife scene has changed dramatically in recent years amid an increase in raids on \u201cnon-traditional venues\u201d and the growing persecution of queer people since Russia\u2019s Supreme Court outlawed the \u201cinternational LGBT movement\u201d in 2023. <br/>Armed police have been known to <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/05/01/russian-security-forces-raid-moscow-swingers-club-in-search-of-lgbt-propaganda-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">terrify</a> revellers, forcing them to lie face down on the floor, sometimes for hours at a time, and in several cases, beating and humiliating party-goers while checking their documents and phones.",

    "summary": "<br/>Ukraine is having a tougher than usual time at the moment. On the frontlines, the battle of <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/06/russia-urges-ukrainian-troops-to-surrender-as-battle-for-pokrovsk-enters-critical-phase-en-news\">Pokrovsk</a> is raging, and it does not look like Ukraine is winning it. Nor do things look good for the country\u2019s energy resilience after months of an intensive Russian air campaign targeting key <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/23/braced-for-the-cold-en\">infrastructure</a>. According to the UN, this could trigger another major humanitarian crisis in the already war-ravaged country. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/f76583f3b6fe4a35b1834d854231ef22.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Ukrainian servicemen hold position in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, 28 October 2025. Photo: Press service of the 24 Mechanised brigade. .</figcaption><br/>The geopolitical picture looks equally grim. The delivery of long-range Tomahawk missiles, sought by Kyiv for months now, has again been ruled <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/03/trump-not-really-considering-transfer-of-tomahawks-to-ukraine-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">out</a> by the US president, Donald Trump. What\u2019s more, after his meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in South Korea on 30 October, Trump <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjqKGq3-C9Q\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that the US and China would work together to end the war in Ukraine. <br/>The possibility of a productive collaboration between Trump and Xi on peace in Ukraine, let alone its successful conclusion, is remote. And even if there was a Washington-Beijing sponsored deal, it would not be in Ukraine\u2019s favour as became clear a few days later. During a high-profile, two-day visit of the Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, to China on 3 and 4 November, Beijing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-president-xi-meets-with-russias-prime-minister-mishustin-2025-11-04/\" target=\"_blank\">showed</a> no signs of backing out of its partnership with Russia, which is key to sustaining the Kremlin\u2019s war machine. <br/>Nor does the continuing <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/24/right-on-the-money-en\" target=\"_blank\">delay</a> in approving an EU loan to Ukraine worth \u20ac60 billion and backed by frozen Russian assets bode well for Kyiv. Given all this bad news, it was therefore no surprise that Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, <a href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1985681626055983310\" target=\"_blank\">leapt</a> at what looked, on the surface, like good news in the European Commission\u2019s latest assessment of Kyiv\u2019s progress towards EU membership. \u201e <br/><br/>This provides easy ammunition for Ukraine\u2019s detractors inside the EU. Chief among them is Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose obstruction tactics have frustrated European commission efforts on Ukraine\u2019s accession.  <br/>The European Commission notes in its report that Ukraine has made progress in all of the 33 different chapters of the accession negotiations. This is as remarkable as it is commendable given that the country has done so in the shadow of Russia\u2019s aggression since February 2022. Yet, in many areas, progress is modest at best. A more careful analysis of the 2025 commission <a href=\"https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/ukraine-report-2025_en\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> suggests that positive news, if any, is in the presentation, not the underlying facts. <br/>For example, in relation to the fight against corruption the commission <a href=\"https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/17115494-8122-4d10-8a06-2cf275eecde7_en?filename=ukraine-report-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that recent developments \u201ccast doubts on Ukraine\u2019s commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\u201d. This is primarily a reference to attempts by Zelensky\u2019s government to limit the independence of the country\u2019s anti-corruption institutions. The issue triggered massive public <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/07/23/first-wartime-protests-in-ukraine-as-zelensky-signs-law-weakening-anti-corruption-bodies-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">protests</a> in the summer and <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/07/25/zelensky-backtracks-on-anti-corruption-agencies-law-after-protests-and-eu-backlash-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">forced</a> a partial government <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/07/31/bill-restoring-independence-to-ukraines-anti-corruption-bodies-is-passed-following-backlash-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">climb-down</a>. <br/>Worryingly, the commission also notes \u201cpolitical pressure on anti-corruption activists\u201d and \u201charassment and intimidation of journalists\u201d. This includes \u201ccases of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) related to journalistic investigations\u201d. <br/>Meanwhile, in the fight against serious and organised crime, the commission report states: \u201cThe freezing and confiscation of criminal assets remain very limited.\u201d Other shortcomings concern limited progress on decentralisation, lack of transparency in recruitment to civil service positions, the independence and impartiality of the judiciary, and the persistence of torture and ill treatment in the prison and detention system. <br/>On the one hand, it is not surprising that these shortcomings exist. Ukraine has been fighting an existential war for almost four years. The country has only been a candidate country for EU membership since June 2022, four months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Accession negotiations didn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/15/european-council-conclusions-14-and-15-december-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">start</a> until December 2023. <br/>Yet it is the persistence of these highly visible, easily exploitable problems related to fundamental values of the EU that are causing <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/articles/cwy1wp2krw5o\" target=\"_blank\">concern</a>. Almost identical issues were raised in the European Commission\u2019s opinion on Ukraine\u2019s membership application in 2022. It was raised again in the 2023 report and again in last year\u2019s progress report on accession negotiations. <br/>It may be an exaggeration to claim that Ukraine is experiencing a turn towards a more autocratic style of presidential government under Zelensky. But there clearly are signs that war-time <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukrainian-politics-war/\" target=\"_blank\">politics</a> in Kyiv has a darker side that does little to bolster the country\u2019s credentials for EU membership. \u201e <br/><br/>The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, continues to insist that membership for Ukraine by 2030 \u201cis a realistic goal\u201d. But the EU\u2019s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, is more guarded.  <br/>This provides easy ammunition for Ukraine\u2019s detractors inside the EU. Chief among them is Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose obstruction tactics have <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/29/hungarys-viktor-orban-hopes-to-form-anti-ukraine-bloc-to-end-eu-aid-to-kyiv-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">frustrated</a> European commission efforts on Ukraine\u2019s accession. Poland and Slovakia have joined Hungary in defying the EU\u2019s efforts to complete an updated trade deal with Ukraine. Opposition to Ukraine from within the EU has now been further strengthened by the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/czechia-andrej-babis-clinches-coalition-deal-far-right\" target=\"_blank\">formation</a> of a eurosceptic, hard-right populist government coalition in Czechia. <br/>The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, continues to <a href=\"https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/remarks-high-representativevice-president-kallas-and-commissioner-kos-2025-enlargement-package-2025-11-04_en\" target=\"_blank\">insist</a> that membership for Ukraine by 2030 \u201cis a realistic goal\u201d. But the EU\u2019s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, is more guarded. She has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/hu/speech_25_2589\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> that \u201cfuture accession treaties will need to contain stronger safeguards\u201d to \u201creassure our citizens in the Member States that the integrity of our Union and democratic values are ensured, also after the accession\u201d. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9493f85b-528b-4b75-98c3-027a3724748a\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> with the Financial Times, she said that she did not \u201cwant to go down as the commissioner bringing in the Trojan horses\u201d. <br/>Given the detail in Ukraine\u2019s 2025 progress report on areas where Kyiv clearly needs to make urgent improvements, this suggests that the tough times for Ukraine are likely to continue, and not just in its war with Russia. Though the future of the EU and Ukraine have become ever more closely entwined since February 2022, there remains a bigger question for the EU. Its dilemma is how to balance holding the line on its membership standards and enabling Ukraine to hold the line against Russia.   <br/><br/>Stefan Wolff is a Professor of International Security at the University of Birmingham and Tetyana Malyarenko is a Professor of International Relations at the Odesa Law Academy. <br/>This <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/lack-of-progress-on-joining-eu-caps-another-bad-month-for-ukraine-268921\">article</a> was first published in <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://theconversation.com/\">The Conversation</a>.

    "summary": "<br/>In the wake of recent escalating rhetoric between Washington and Moscow surrounding a return to nuclear testing, Novaya Gazeta Europa spoke to leading experts about what this might mean in practice. Should we really expect a return and if so, what could it lead to? <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/e07853f245c1414eaf0e432bcfadce95.jpeg\"/><figcaption>The launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile at a test site in Plesetsk, Russia, 22 October 2025. Photo: Russian Defence Ministry.</figcaption><br/>This week <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/05/russian-defence-minister-recommends-preparations-be-made-for-return-to-nuclear-testing-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">saw</a> Russian Defence Minister Andrey Belousov formally suggest to Vladimir Putin that immediate preparations be made for the full scale testing of nuclear weapons on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in Russia\u2019s far north. Putin responded by instructing Belousov to \u201cexamine the advisability of commencing preparations for such tests\u201d. <br/>Should we expect nuclear tests? <br/>Post-Soviet Russia has never conducted a nuclear test, with the last Soviet era test occurring in 1990. Russian journalist Farida Rustamova <a href=\"https://t.me/faridaily24/1767\" target=\"_blank\">believes</a> that, for now at least, the Kremlin will refrain from any resumption, and that these latest statements should really be interpreted as a warning to US President Donald Trump to \u201cmind his language\u201d.  \u201e <br/>A Russian foreign and defence policy expert posits that any resumption of testing might actually represent an attempt to halt tensions rising even further as part of an \u201cescalate to de-escalate\u201d strategy.  <br/>Russian sabre-rattling when it comes to nuclear testing is nothing new. Maxim Starchak, an expert on Russian nuclear policy, points out that as recently as 2023, Putin instructed the Defence Ministry and Russia\u2019s atomic energy agency Rosatom to be ready for new tests. \u201cToday the minister confirmed that we need to be ready, but this is probably a political move as nuclear testing falls within Rosatom\u2019s remit,\u201d Starchak said, \u201dBelousov wants to show that he favours a rapid response to any American tests.\u201d <br/>Not all experts completely rule out new Russian tests, however. Pavel Luzin, a Russian foreign and defence policy expert, posits that any resumption of testing might actually represent an attempt to halt tensions rising even further as part of an \u201cescalate to de-escalate\u201d strategy in which it would be necessary \u201cfor Russia to display its readiness and willingness to use nuclear weapons\u201d.  <br/>Luzin admits that testing itself might be quite far off, with the immediate goal of the current rhetoric being to apply \u201cpsychological pressure on the West\u201d. Announcing Russia\u2019s preparations for renewed testing only represents a \u201chalf step\u201d towards any actual tests taking place in the near future, he adds.  <br/>Is Russia ready for nuclear tests? <br/>Russia currently has just one nuclear test site \u2014 that on the Arctic Ocean archipelago of Novaya Zemlya. Despite the last test taking place there in 1990, it has continually been maintained since then in readiness for any future tests. Russia has an advantage, Starchak says, in that it has almost completely modernised its nuclear forces, something that the US is only just starting to do, and that nuclear tests may be seen as necessary to check existing weapons as well as to test new ones.  <br/>\u201cTechincally, existing weapons can be tested through scientific experiments as well as computer modelling, but some physicists have advocated for testing as a means to create new warheads. If Russia decides to take this step, it would involve moving beyond the boundaries of the existing New START Treaty\u201d, Starchak said.  \u201e <br/>Starchak notes that ultimately, whether or not Russian nuclear tests come to pass may come down to the appetite of the US Republican Party to increase the country\u2019s nuclear stockpiles.  <br/>The New START Treaty, which was signed in 2010 and ratified in 2011, limits the amount of strategic nuclear arms either the US or Russia can hold at any one time, although, crucially, it is due to expire in February.  <br/>Starchak notes that ultimately, whether or not Russian nuclear tests come to pass may come down to the appetite of the US Republican Party to increase the country\u2019s nuclear stockpiles. If that did happen, Russia may feel obliged to respond in kind. Such a move would be costly and could mean \u201cthe development of some expensive missile systems would have to be abandoned in favour of the arms race.\u201d  <br/>Starchak believes that any testing by either country would be limited \u201cprimarily to underground explosions\u201d and would avoid the use of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) altogether.  <br/>American tests <br/>Luzin stresses that the US has also not carried out any nuclear tests in over 30 years, and so Russian rhetoric over its own potential resumption cannot be seen as a direct response to American activity. Instead, he argues it should be interpreted through the lens of \u201cRussia trying to put pressure on the West because Russia\u2019s situation has got worse, not improved, over the last year\u201d.  <br/>Nevertheless, US President Donald Trump has followed through, in part at least, on his recent statements concerning the need for the US to carry out its own tests. In response to news that Russia had conducted tests of its nuclear-capable 9M730 Burevestnik and Poseidon weapons in October, Trump <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/30/trump-orders-first-us-nuclear-tests-since-1992-after-russias-burevestnik-launch-en-news\">ordered</a> the Pentagon to resume American testing \u201cimmediately\u201d, citing the need for the US to respond to the fact that \u201cother countries\u201d were already doing so. <br/>On Wednesday, the US did <a href=\"https://www.vandenberg.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/4328255/gt-254-afgsc-validates-reliability-readiness-of-icbm-force-with-minuteman-iii-t/\" target=\"_blank\">conduct</a> a test launch of a nuclear-capable Minuteman III ICBM, although on this occasion no nuclear payload was attached. The missile successfully flew approximately 6,600 kilometres from its launch site at California\u2019s Vandenberg Air Force Base to the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.  <br/>While it is hard to say where a resumption in nuclear testing might lead, Tilman Ruff, an honorary principal fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/if-the-us-resumes-nuclear-weapons-testing-this-would-be-extremely-dangerous-for-humanity-268661\">commented</a> recently that the Doomsday Clock \u2014 one of the most authoritative and best-known assessments of the existential threats facing the world \u2014 had moved further forward this year than it had ever done before, <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/30/the-nuclear-option-en\">reflecting</a> what an extraordinarily dangerous time in history this is.",

Once a major player in the export of Russian oil, at its height Gunvor handled up to 40% of the country\u2019s seaborne oil exports and was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/oil/russian-oil-trading-king-gunvor-crown-slips-idUSL5E8KC9OS/\" target=\"_blank\">dubbed</a> the king of Kremlin oil by market analysts. <br/>A close ally of Vladimir Putin, Timchenko, who was himself <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jl23331\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> by the US government following Russia\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, officially ended his involvement with the company by selling his stake to T\u00f6rnqvist just prior to being sanctioned. <br/>Gunvor <a href=\"https://gunvorgroup.com/news/gunvor-statement-regarding-the-war-in-ukraine/#:~:text=Gunvor%20Group%20unequivocally%20condemns%20the,aiding%20the%20resulting%20humanitarian%20crisis.\" target=\"_blank\">maintains</a> that it stepped back from the bulk of direct business and ties with Russia following its annexation of Crimea, and publicly condemned its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. <br/>However, Novaya Europe has found that T\u00f6rnqvist maintains close personal connections with Russia and continues to make frequent visits to Moscow, where he owns a mansion in an exclusive gated community in the prestigious suburb of Rublyovka. <br/>Pietras told POLITICO that Gunvor had \u201calways been open and transparent about its ownership and business\u201d and that it would welcome the opportunity to correct what he called the Treasury Department\u2019s \u201cclear misunderstanding\u201d of its operations.",

Probably. But what of it? You imposed sanctions on us,\u201d Lukashenko said, adding: \u201cLet those balloons fly\u201d. <br/>Lukashenko then turned his attention to another neighbour, Poland, whom he accused of reneging on a deal to release several Belarusians accused of espionage to show their solidarity with Lithuania, <a href=\"https://eng.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-details-how-poland-derailed-prisoner-swap-deal-involving-pochobut-173143-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">adding</a> that Belarus had in return been prepared to release Polish journalist Andrzej Poczobut, who is serving an eight-year prison sentence after being convicted of \u201cinciting hatred\u201d for his coverage of the 2020 anti-government protests in Belarus. \u201e <br/>This diatribe was a return to form reminiscent of his autocratic heyday when he would ensure that no journalist attending his press conferences would escape his wrath.  <br/>While <a href=\"https://eng.belta.by/president/view/lukashenko-to-adversaries-you-cant-crush-belarus-and-russia-173141-2025/\" target=\"_blank\">paying</a> his usual lip service to Belarus\u2019s continued devotion to the Kremlin in the face of Western calumny \u2014 \u201cTheir goal is to crush us, along with the Russians\u201d \u2014 and making a casual threat to Europe while referencing the Soviet victory in World War II \u2014 \u201cDo they truly wish to relive what happened in the mid-20th century?

But this diatribe was a return to form reminiscent of his autocratic heyday when he would ensure that no journalist attending his press conferences would escape his wrath. It also highlighted two important issues. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/dc55dccbd91249d5a0a1464a57f61327a/large\"/><figcaption>Raman Pratasevich at a Foreign Ministry briefing in Minsk, 14 June 2021. Photo: AFP / Scanpix / LETA.</figcaption><br/>First, the sanctions Lukashenko claims to pay little heed to are both working and aggravating him enormously, and that the closure of the country\u2019s borders with Lithuania and Poland has implications for everybody in the country, not just those unlucky enough to be stuck at the sole open border crossing with Poland near Brest.  <br/>Second, Lukashenko\u2019s renewed bluster against the West can largely be attributed to one Donald Trump, who brought the ageing autocrat back in from the cold and onto the international stage when he unilaterally began <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/11/lukashenko-releases-another-52-political-prisoners-from-belarusian-jails-after-meeting-with-trump-envoy-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">negotiating</a> with him for the release of political prisoners earlier this year.  \u201e <br/>Of course, the real headline here is the sensational acknowledgement that Pratasevich was a Belarusian intelligence agent.  <br/>No longer some tinpot dictator from the 1990s living on borrowed time, but an active player in international negotiations who has the lives of Belarusian political prisoners and the safety of European air traffic in his gift, Lukashenko is suddenly able to say things such as \u201clet those balloons fly\u201d with total confidence in his own impunity. <br/>Of course, the real headline here is the sensational acknowledgement that Pratasevich was a Belarusian intelligence agent. Though he has largely disappeared from the spotlight, Pratasevich nevertheless briefly resurfaced to <a href=\"https://t.me/lgbelarussegodnya/28991\" target=\"_blank\">confirm</a> Lukashenko\u2019s claim, about which he gave no further details. But who cares what Pratasevich says, anyway? <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/974df2b4256643789aab60953a2862d7a/large\"/><figcaption>A Lithuanian-Belarusian border crossing in southeastern Lithuania, 28 October 2025.

In actual fact, Lukashenko only brought him up to remind everyone that sanctions were imposed for no reason.  \u201e <br/>In a political Catch-22 of which he is no doubt fully aware, his stockpile of opposition hostages is the only bargaining chip Lukashenko has.  <br/>If Lukashenko is serious about getting Western sanctions on Minsk lifted, he has no choice other than to release all the political prisoners his regime has in its gulag, and yet, in a political Catch-22 of which he is no doubt fully aware, his stockpile of opposition hostages is the only bargaining chip Lukashenko has, and is the sole reason the Trump administration would have to talk to him. <br/>Coincidentally, the day of Lukashenko\u2019s tirade marked exactly 50 days since opposition politician Mikalai Statkevich was abducted and reimprisoned by the Belarusian security services after <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/18/the-power-of-refusal-en\" target=\"_blank\">refusing</a> to be forced into exile in Lithuania.

Vladimir Putin readily <a href=\"https://t.me/news_kremlin/6587\" target=\"_blank\">agreed</a> with Belousov and said that Russia should respond to nuclear tests by \u201cother parties to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty\u201d, according to the Kremlin. <br/>\u201cI instruct the Foreign Ministry, Defence Ministry, secret services and relevant civilian departments to ... collect additional data \u2026 and coordinate proposals on ... starting ... preparations for nuclear weapons tests,\u201d Putin said. <br/>As Russia has not carried out a nuclear test since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, any decision to restart testing would be a serious escalation in its nuclear rivalry with the US. <br/>Early on Wednesday, Washington <a href=\"https://www.vandenberg.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/4328255/gt-254-afgsc-validates-reliability-readiness-of-icbm-force-with-minuteman-iii-t/\" target=\"_blank\">conducted</a> a test launch of the Minuteman III nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, though it wasn\u2019t carrying a nuclear payload. <br/>Writing on his Truth Social platform shortly before a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, on 30 October, US President Donald Trump said that he had <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/30/trump-orders-first-us-nuclear-tests-since-1992-after-russias-burevestnik-launch-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">instructed</a> the Pentagon to resume nuclear weapons testing \u201con an equal basis\u201d with Russia and China \u201cimmediately\u201d, citing their own testing. <br/>Late last month, Putin said that the Russian Armed Forces had successfully tested their new nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered intercontinental missile, the 9M730 Burevestnik and the Poseidon, a torpedo powered by atomic energy that has been described as capable of causing \u201cnuclear tsunamis\u201d.

While Sehili profited from certain privileges as a French citizen, that very status also made him a potentially valuable bargaining chip in the Kremlin\u2019s negotiations with Western governments.  <br/>Every day, NGOs and charities work to shed light on the mistreatment and suffering of wrongfully incarcerated people across the world, and cases such as Sehili\u2019s serve only to divert time and resources from other, far more important cases elsewhere. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/d0051c7e8f8f4c689027b9358b2c1acf.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Sofiane Sehili. Photo: Instagram.</figcaption><br/>Sehili\u2019s record attempt was neither a political act, nor was it a subversive one \u2014 it appears that his desire to set a new time for the journey was his sole motivation for crossing the border illegally. Nor is he alone in his quest to earn a reputation as a trailblazer \u2014 he is joined by a cohort of Western influencers and content creators each attempting to outdo the others in their choice of ever more exotic destination or challenging activity. <br/>In an attempt to position themselves in a unique content niche, more and more influencers are travelling to Russia, where they are at pains to mention how kind and hospitable the people are, so different, supposedly, from what they were led to believe by their own media. Such superficial gloss is capable of concealing the struggles of entire peoples.  <br/>In October, Ukrainian media outlet United24 <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/02/22/under-the-influence-en\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> an investigation into foreign influencers working in Russia, such as Alexandra Jost, a Russian-American whose YouTube channel, Sasha Meets Russia, frequently parrots Kremlin talking points, and who, United24 revealed, is part of a larger enterprise that directly benefits from Kremlin funding through the Presidential Foundation for Cultural Initiatives (PFKI).  \u201e <br/><br/>Too often, Western influencers end up reprising the talking points of Russian influencers \u2014 and thus, the Kremlin \u2014 while claiming that their intention was simply to show the \u201creal\u201d Russia and to connect with its people.  <br/>Established in 2021 to finance cultural and creative projects, the PFKI now frequently engages in the dissemination of overt state propaganda and the whitewashing of the regime\u2019s crimes in Ukraine. While the Russian and Western influencers in the organisation\u2019s pay often film apolitical subject matter such as cultural activities or day-to-day life in Russia, they still frequently repeat Kremlin propaganda narratives such as Russia\u2019s supposed safety \u2014 a direct result of it being a brutal police state \u2014 or its respect for so-called \u201ctraditional values\u201d \u2014 the result of <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/12/07/moscow-police-raid-two-queer-venues-as-russias-lgbt-crackdown-continues-en-news\">discrimination</a> against and the violent <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/02/19/police-beat-and-detain-russian-student-for-participating-in-queer-group-chats-en-news\">persecution</a> of queer people, <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/04/10/two-criminal-cases-opened-against-russian-feminist-activists-en-news\">feminists</a> and those <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/07/14/nursing-a-grudge-en\">choosing</a> to be \u201cchild free\u201d. <br/>According to United24, PFKI also funds more overt war propaganda, financing creators such as Ruslan Ostashko, who became the guardian of a Ukrainian child abducted and deported illegally from an orphanage in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region. <br/>Too often, Western influencers simply end up reprising the talking points of Russian influencers \u2014 and thus, the Kremlin \u2014 while claiming that their intention was simply to show the \u201creal\u201d Russia and to connect with its people. Such an approach is simplistic and dishonest, however, and substitutes a redacted and state-approved version of peoples\u2019 lives in place of their own lived realities.  <br/>A significant part of that reality is unfortunately the brutal regime and its willing supporters, its violent suppression of any criticism or dissent, and its daily terror against the Ukrainian people. While denying the basic humanity of entire groups of people is indefensible, whitewashing the actions of criminal regimes, or even worse, willingly disseminating their propaganda in an attempt to appear compassionate and brave, is both egocentric and ignorant. <br/>Sehili may have been, in his own words, naive in seeking to grow his online following by embarking on his adventurous journey, but like so many other Western influencers in Russia, he\u2019s also, whether he realises it or not, little more than a cog in the propaganda machine used by the Kremlin to influence global opinion. <br/>In their quest for a unique perspective and an ever-so-daring video, foreign influencers in Russia are risking not only their own lives and those of the people they interact with, they are also acting as useful idiots for the Kremlin and demonstrating their blatant disregard for the plight of others.     <br/><br/>Views expressed in opinion pieces do not necessarily reflect the position of Novaya Gazeta Europe.

Previously, the notices remained valid indefinitely, meaning military enlistment offices could set appointments for new conscripts to report to them months in advance \u2014 during which they were forbidden to leave the country. <br/>The initiative was authored by the head of the State Duma\u2019s Defence Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, and his deputy, Andrey Krasov.  <br/>Kartapolov <a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/politics/22/07/2025/687fc0419a79479f70d91a1b\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the changes would streamline the work of conscription offices, which would now be able to work \u201ccalmly\u201d year round without \u201cstorming and rushing every six months\u201d, and mean that conscripts would no longer \u201canxiously await spring or summer\u201d. <br/>Human rights groups, however, have <a href=\"https://t.me/voen_advokaty\" target=\"_blank\">argued</a> that the law merely codifies what has already become standard practice: authorities routinely summoning non-reservists to enlistment offices outside the official draft periods, citing the need to \u201cclarify personal data\u201d before sending them for medical examinations. <br/>Alongside the conscription changes, Putin <a href=\"http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202511040012?index=1\" target=\"_blank\">signed</a> a second law on Tuesday authorising Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry to use army reservists to guard key infrastructure sites, including oil refineries and other energy facilities, which have come under increasingly frequent attack by Ukrainian drones in recent months. <br/><a href=\"https://www.rbc.ru/politics/04/11/2025/690a12169a7947f8308639d2\" target=\"_blank\">According</a> to Vladimir Tsimlyansky, deputy head of the Russian Defence Ministry\u2019s mobilisation department, the law will allow the ministry to assign the country\u2019s most \u201dhighly trained and patriotic citizens\u201d to \u201cprotect civilian facilities deep within Russian territory\u201d. <br/>On Friday, Security Service of Ukraine head Vasyl Malyuk <a href=\"https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/10/31/8005272/\">said</a> Ukrainian forces had carried out some 160 successful strikes on Russian oil facilities so far this year, disabling around 37% of Moscow's total refining capacity.",

    "summary": "<br/>Since August, Europe has seen a sharp rise in the number of aerial incursions into its territory in which Russia\u2019s involvement is suspected, from swarms of drones appearing near military bases, airports, and energy facilities to far more obvious airspace violations by Russian fighter jets. Novaya Europe has collected and analysed all known incidents of Russian hybrid warfare over the past three months.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/ecca1b8ab64245ebafc89795618ee10b.jpeg\"/><figcaption>A sign on the perimeter fence at Germany\u2019s Frankfurt-am-Main Airport banning the use of drones, 11 October 2025. Photo: Fraport / Hessen / dpa / Scanpix / LETA.</figcaption><br/>Since August 2025, the number of incidents involving airspace breaches and unidentified drones near critical infrastructure has grown noticeably across Europe. At least a dozen countries, most of them NATO members, have reported sightings of suspicious drones <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/10/poland-downs-multiple-russian-drones-after-huge-number-enter-its-airspace-overnight-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">flying</a> over military bases, Russian fighter jets <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/20/estonia-requests-nato-article-4-consultation-after-russian-fighter-jets-breach-airspace-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">violating</a> airspace, and temporary airport closures prompted by drone collision risks. <br/>European governments are ramping up aerial surveillance, discussing<a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/1008/1537440-germany-drones/\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>new rules for the use of military force, and increasingly describing these events as part of a hybrid war waged by the Kremlin. At the same time, there is no official confirmation of Russia\u2019s involvement in most of the incidents. <br/>Over the past three months, such episodes have been recorded in various countries: from Ukraine\u2019s neighbours <a href=\"https://dailymare.com/news/drones-from-the-east-over-poland-wreckage-near-nato-base-in-malbork-security-or-safe,1791\" id=\"djp36v4d2\" target=\"_blank\">Poland</a> and Romania to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/10/03/drones-detected-flying-over-military-base-in-eastern-belgium-reports-say\" id=\"gn7tf66hy\" target=\"_blank\">Belgium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/09/26/unidentified-drones-spark-security-alert-at-french-military-base#:~:text=An%20incident%20involving%20unidentified%20drones,ongoing%20investigation%2C%20military%20officials%20confirmed\" id=\"xrcrsg1um\" target=\"_blank\">France</a>. Novaya Europe has compiled an exhaustive list of these incidents and attempted to assess whether they could be considered part of a coordinated campaign. <br/>The sky over Europe <br/>Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, European countries have regularly recorded such incidents. In 2022, unidentified drones were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/norway-oil-safety-regulator-warns-threats-unidentified-drones-2022-09-26/\" id=\"ppm9lq4hg\" target=\"_blank\">spotted</a> near oil platforms in Norway, in 2023, a Russian missile <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/12/29/poland-says-russian-missile-entered-its-airspace-from-ukraine-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">violated</a> Polish airspace, and in 2024 the US Air Force <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britain-us-air-bases-drones-cfb5643bfed2a45be61d107aa063477b\" id=\"kekj8c2ix\" target=\"_blank\">detected</a> drone flights near its bases in the UK. <br/>At the time, these cases were seen as isolated incidents, but they had become so frequent by this autumn that many began to speak of the provocations as a new Kremlin strategy to unnerve Europe. <br/>According to our research, between early August and late October this year, there have been at least 67 incidents in Europe involving aircraft and drones believed to be linked to Russia. In recent months, the number of cases has increased steadily: from just 1-3 incidents per week in August to a peak of 17 in a single week at the end of September. <br/>What\u2019s particularly notable is how the geography of these incursions is constantly expanding: Novaya Europe found that, in recent months, incidents had been recorded in at least 17 European countries. Below are the most high-profile episodes during that period: <br/>\u25cf 18 August, Norway. An Su-33 fighter jet entered Norwegian territory for one minute near Vard\u00f8, the country\u2019s eastern border 170 kilometres from Murmansk. The incident was the <a href=\"https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/norge-slutter-seg-til-natos-fordommelse-av-russisk-krenkelse-av-alliert-luftrom/id3119874/\" id=\"0eohc49u3\" target=\"_blank\">third</a> Russian aerial incursion into Norwegian airspace this year alone. Before that, there had been no violations of this kind for over 10 years. <br/>\u25cf 9-10 September, Poland. Around 20 Russian drones <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/10/poland-downs-multiple-russian-drones-after-huge-number-enter-its-airspace-overnight-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">breached</a> the border. Some were shot down, but most crashed on their own, with their wreckage recovered. <br/>\u25cf 19 September, Estonia. Three armed MiG-31s <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/09/20/estonia-requests-nato-article-4-consultation-after-russian-fighter-jets-breach-airspace-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">remained</a> in Estonian airspace for 12 minutes. <br/>\u25cf 22\u201326 September, Denmark. Numerous unidentified drones were <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/02/russian-oil-tanker-detained-in-france-on-suspicion-of-launching-drones-over-denmark-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">detected</a> over military bases and critical infrastructure; five civilian and military airports were closed for a week. <br/>\u25cf 25 September \u2013 4 October, Germany. Initially, drones were spotted over critical infrastructure including military bases, a hospital, and energy facilities in northern Germany; then, for two consecutive days, Munich Airport had to be <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/drone-munich-airport-nato-russia-b2839435.html\" id=\"dt1i2gpbc\" target=\"_blank\">closed</a> due to drone threats. Over 10,000 passengers were affected. <br/>\u25cf 3 October, Belgium. 15 drones <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2025/10/03/drones-detected-flying-over-military-base-in-eastern-belgium-reports-say\" id=\"c364fky4h\" target=\"_blank\">flew</a> over the Elsenborn military base near the German border <br/>\u25cf 21\u201327 October, Lithuania. A series of smuggling balloons from Belarus closed the airspace over Vilnius several times: the airport suspended operations four times in a single week and the country closed its border with Belarus until 30 November. <br/>\u25cf 31 October\u20131 November, Belgium. Kleine-Brogel, a NATO air base where US nuclear weapons are likely stored, recorded two drone flights, though attempts to shoot them down were unsuccessful. <br/>Found objects <br/>We divided all suspected Russian-linked aerial incursions into three main categories: airspace incursions, the discovery of combat drone wreckage (if a border violation was not recorded), and suspected surveillance of critical infrastructure. <br/>\u25cf Airspace violations <br/>Since August 2025, the airspace of EU countries has been violated at least 15 times. Five of these incidents involved manned Russian military aircraft \u2014 a total of seven fighter jets, one refuelling plane and one military helicopter. Another five incidents <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/10/27/lithuania-to-close-border-with-belarus-indefinitely-amid-repeated-balloon-incursions-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">involved</a> balloons, likely launched by smugglers from Belarus into Lithuania. The remaining cases were brief incursions by drones, both Russian military drones and unidentified drones from Russia or Belarus. Russia denies any deliberate violation of airspace in all these cases. <br/>Intercepts of Russian aircraft approaching European borders \u2014 where a European fighter approaches the offending aircraft and escorts it away from the border \u2014 occur frequently, up to <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2025/01/13/nato-intercepts-of-russian-aircraft-stable-in-2024-over-prior-year/\" id=\"fmak423eq\" target=\"_blank\">hundreds</a> of times a year. However, actual airspace incursions, even lasting only a few seconds, are extremely rare. Such events are considered serious violations of a country\u2019s territorial integrity and can trigger immediate and decisive responses. <br/>For example, in 2015, one crew member was killed when a Russian fighter jet <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34912581\" target=\"_blank\">entered</a> Turkish airspace for 17 seconds and was shot down by Turkish air defences after being instructed to change direction 10 times. <br/>\u25cf Military drone debris <br/>Remnants of Russian drones have been discovered on at least 10 different occasions in various places across Europe, mostly in Poland and Romania, both of which border Ukraine. For the most part, those that were found turned out to be Geran-1 and Geran-2 drones, modified from Iranian Shahed drones, and not always equipped with explosives. These so-called decoy drones are used by Russia to overwhelm Ukrainian air defence systems. <br/>Sometimes, mass drone incursions appear to be deliberate provocations. On the night of September 9\u201310, around 20 drones entered Polish airspace, local authorities <a href=\"https://dailymare.com/news/drones-from-the-east-over-poland-wreckage-near-nato-base-in-malbork-security-or-safe,1791\" id=\"kiel0cjkr\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that <a href=\"https://tvpworld.com/89163917/92-russian-drones-approached-poland-in-incursion-zelenskyy\" id=\"i5ppajxee\" target=\"_blank\">over 90</a> drones were involved, some of which were intercepted by the Ukrainian military. <br/>In some cases, drones were found far from the theatre of military operations, such as in <a href=\"https://sofiaglobe.com/2025/09/16/bulgarian-navy-destroys-drone-in-black-sea-east-of-varna/#:~:text=ministry%20said\" id=\"xki97e154\" target=\"_blank\">Bulgaria</a> or <a href=\"https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defence/19.09.2025-decoy-drone-tail-washed-up-on-beach-near-ventspils-latvia.a614975/\" id=\"z25ejymew\" target=\"_blank\">Latvia</a>. Evidently they sank in territorial waters and were washed ashore. <img src=\"https://imagedelivery.net/p-5sVXv4TM8k3PD0xTiUIA/131a9fab741a4854a7f50151aecf0094a/large\"/><figcaption>Members of Poland\u2019s National Territorial Defence Forces at the crash site of a Russian drone in the village of Wohy\u0144, eastern Poland, 10 September 2025. Photo: EPA / Wojtek Jargilo.</figcaption><br/>\u25cf \u2018Spy\u2019 drones <br/>Unlike the first two categories, \u201cspy\u201d drone incidents are much harder to trace back to the operator. Indeed, some drones that were detected by the authorities turned out to have been flown by <a href=\"https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/06/24/il-diffuse-sur-tiktok-des-images-interdites-dune-centrale-nucleaire-filmee-avec-son-drone-12774784.php#:~:text=Les%20faits%20remontent%20au%20premier,des%20interdictions%20les%20plus%20strictes\" id=\"38i6vfc75\" target=\"_blank\">TikTok</a> content creators or used to film animals in the wild. In cases where such drones approach critical infrastructure, their pilots face heavy fines that can run to tens or even hundreds of thousands of euros. <br/>Nonetheless, most suspicious incidents have markers of deliberate espionage or sabotage. Typically, it was groups of 10\u201315 drones which moved in coordinated patterns and were often noticeably larger than typical civilian models that were observed near critical infrastructure. <br/>According to Novaya Europe\u2019s calculations, at least 49 such incidents have been recorded in Europe since August 2025. They were most frequently spotted near airports (23 incidents), military bases (17), and various government buildings (5). <br/>In most cases where drones have been found, investigations are still ongoing, and no official conclusions have yet been reached about who was behind them. European leaders, however, have repeatedly said they believe a professional actor or <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/latvia-says-denmark-told-allies-drone-activity-linked-state-actor-2025-09-25/\" id=\"xhrtmeqmq\" target=\"_blank\">state</a> is behind the launches. Former German chancellor Olaf Scholz directly <a href=\"https://www.stern.de/politik/ausland/unbemannte-flugobjekte--russland-weist-vorwuerfe-zu-drohnen-in-deutschland-zurueck-36108438.html\" id=\"ijpfk95qt\" target=\"_blank\">linked</a> the wave of drone incursions to Russia, while admitting that definitive proof of Moscow\u2019s involvement had still not been established.  <br/>Some experts suggest that the launches may be originating from Russia\u2019s Baltic exclave of <a href=\"https://www.trtworld.com/article/41584a745700\" target=\"_blank\">Kaliningrad</a>, while most investigations <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250926-denmark-drone-incursions-all-signs-point-to-russia-suspect-ships?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" id=\"5fkqb2zti\" target=\"_blank\">point</a> to the involvement of the country\u2019s so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2014 vessels sailing under the flag of a third country that are used to export Russian oil in breach of international sanctions. <br/>For example, in August a cargo ship, the Scanlark, was detained in Germany; investigators believe it may have been used to launch a drone over a German Navy ship on 26 August. <br/>How Europe is responding <br/>The true scale of Russian surveillance of military and critical infrastructure in Europe may be far greater than media reports suggest. In some countries, lists of such incidents are classified: the Czech authorities have <a href=\"https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/10/10/czech-army-confirms-drone-sightings-over-its-facilities-amid-escalating-drone-activity-across-europe/#google_vignette\" id=\"8ewb0cmr2\" target=\"_blank\">acknowledged</a> increased drone activity near strategic sites but do not make their details public. <br/>Even when suspicious incidents are not considered secret, not every report of a drone makes it into the press. In Denmark, the police <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/drone-munich-airport-nato-russia-b2839435.html\" id=\"ahls4xtfk\" target=\"_blank\">received</a> more than 500 reports from citizens during a barrage of recent drone incursions, but they were unable to process all of them promptly. \u201e <br/>In response to the surveillance and provocations, European governments are passing laws that permit the shooting down of drones violating airspace and threatening infrastructure.  <br/>Heads of Europe\u2019s largest defence firms including <a href=\"https://www.bild.de/politik/ceo-von-airbus-defence-and-space-ruestungs-chef-schlaegt-drohnen-alarm-fuer-deutschland-68d90ee088300c7476b9a01a\" id=\"pna3ama7f\" target=\"_blank\">Airbus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/top-eu-weapons-firm-warns-drone-threat-production-lines/\" id=\"c1i9fdvcr\" target=\"_blank\">Thales Belgium</a> have also confirmed that they have noticed increased drone activity near their facilities, but they add that they have not been given clear instructions about what to do in such situations. <br/>In response to the surveillance and provocations, European governments are passing laws that permit the shooting down of drones violating airspace and threatening infrastructure. Germany is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/germany-allow-police-shoot-down-drones-2025-10-08/\" id=\"ory8evhty\" target=\"_blank\">preparing</a> legislation that would allow police to neutralise such drones using firearms, lasers, or signal jamming. Likewise, both <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/lithuania-authorises-army-shoot-down-drones-violating-its-airspace-2025-09-23/\">Lithuania</a> and<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/romanian-lawmakers-adopt-law-shoot-down-drones-breaching-airspace-2025-02-26/\" id=\"0og68fa00\" target=\"_blank\"> Romania</a> have authorised their armed forces to shoot down drones illegally entering their airspace. <br/>At the same time, defence infrastructure is being upgraded and expanded, and the EU is to make additional funding available, allowing it to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/10/15/eu-plans-functional-drone-wall-against-russia-by-end-of-2027-leak-shows\" target=\"_blank\">assemble</a> a \u201cdrone wall\u201d \u2014 a system of sensors, interceptors and countermeasures along its eastern flank \u2014 by the end of 2027. NATO is also bolstering its eastern presence by launching Operation Eastern Sentry to expand air-defence capabilities, improve its own drone reconnaissance and upgrade its military hardware on NATO\u2019s eastern border. <br/>European politicians <a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2025/09/10/statement-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-on-the-unprovoked-violation-of-the-eu-s-airspace-by-russia/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">say</a> the rise in aerial incidents is aimed at increasing pressure on Europe, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/RC-10-2025-0419_EN.html\" id=\"lvtluxafe\" target=\"_blank\">diverting</a> attention and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/munich-airport-pauses-flights-after-latest-europe-drone-sighting-a85bd9e9?mod=hp_lead_pos11\" id=\"wug27ackw\" target=\"_blank\">weapons</a> away from the front in Ukraine, and sowing fear and doubt about the EU\u2019s ability to protect its own airspace.

    "summary": "<br/>It\u2019s a sunny but frosty October morning as police cars pass up and down sections of the single-lane V\u00e4rska-Ulitina road in southeastern Estonia. A sign warns motorists that the road passes through Russia and that vehicles and pedestrians may not stop. Then there is a fence with barbed wire and 30 metres or so of Russian tarmac hemmed in by pine, spruce and birch trees. If you take it slowly, the drive through Russia takes about nine seconds. Welcome to the Saatse boot, a parcel of Russian territory that juts into Estonia near the village of the same name. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/ec820acc0917435391e086e9f1171ed0.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Estonian soldiers stand in front of the Estonian\u2013Russian border during military exercises in Meremae, Estonia, 20 November 2021. Photo: EPA / Valda Kalnina.</figcaption><br/>On 10 October, Russian servicemen <a href=\"https://news.postimees.ee/8340918/russian-unit-at-the-estonian-border-police-temporarily-close-passage-through-the-saatse-boot\">appeared</a> inside the second Saatse boot, another Russian semi-enclave through which a road connecting several Estonian villages runs for about a kilometre. The Estonian authorities promptly closed the road. Novaya Europe went to the border area to see if locals were afraid of Russia\u2019s belligerent behaviour. Lutep\u00e4\u00e4 <br/>The border village of Lutep\u00e4\u00e4 is a favourite for Estonians in the summer, but right now there are dozens of dachas but almost nobody about, most having left for Tallinn, Tartu and other parts of the country for the winter. However, we do manage to speak to Linda, a rather reserved pensioner who was nevertheless very happy to invite us into her home, which sits right next to a border fence that was <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/1609348725/eastern-border-work-complicated-by-saatse-boot\">built</a> in 2024 to separate Estonia and Russia. <br/>\u201cThere are cameras everywhere now so it\u2019s best not to go too close. If the border guards see you, they\u2019ll come and fine you,\u201d Linda warns me. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/1b7b761bc6ff494799ae6bd3eb66dc46.jpeg\"/><figcaption>The Russian-Estonian border fence. Photo: Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>The precautions make more sense when you understand the local geography. To get to Lutep\u00e4\u00e4, you need to drive along Route 178, which is interrupted at two points by Russian territory, the first 1-kilometre long, the second just 30 metres, the Saatse boot and the small Saatse boot respectively. <br/>The road was shut indefinitely shortly after our visit, making any trip to get here far longer than it used to be until a planned new bypass is completed.  <br/>Linda is dressed in baggy pants, a slightly shabby jacket she wears for gardening and autumn boots. She says no one lives in the village year round, and that she herself is only here to tidy up ahead of winter. <br/>\u201cWe were waiting for a normal road for decades, and now it\u2019s been closed. It\u2019s sad,\u201d Linda tells us. \u201cNow we\u2019re waiting for a new bypass <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/1609833156/photos-work-begins-on-saatse-boot-temporary-detour-road\">through</a> the forest.\u201d <br/>Friends often used to ask Linda how she could live in such close proximity to Russia even before the \u201cincident\u201d, as the Estonian media call the appearance of a dozen Russian servicemen near the Saatse boot. \u201cBut I\u2019m relaxed about it,\u201d Linda says with a shrug. \u201cNo one bothered us.\u201d <br/>Lutep\u00e4\u00e4 is patrolled by Estonian border guards, which, Linda says, gives her a sense of security. When asked if she fears a Russian invasion, she answers with a smile. \u201cOf course, there is a risk Russia will invade, but talking won\u2019t help. We still have to live here.\u201d Disputed territories  <br/>The border between Estonia and Russia was demarcated in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Initially, the two countries intended to swap land so that the borders were smoother and more convenient. But the 1920 Treaty of Tartu, which created the Estonian state, proved a stumbling block as it says the Pechory district of Russia\u2019s Pskov region, across the border, belongs to Estonia. Russia viewed any mention of the Treaty of Tartu as future grounds for Estonia to make other territorial claims. <br/>The Saatse boot became a cause for concern for the Estonian authorities for the first time in years when, on 10 October, the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/1609826698/ppa-temporarily-closes-saatse-boot-passage-after-uptick-in-russian-activity\">reported</a> that a group of at least 10 armed men in unmarked military uniforms had appeared on the road.  <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/723e59d459854614860b81494e98679b.jpeg\"/><figcaption>An Estonian border village. Photo: Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>The Estonians saw it as a provocation and closed the road to civilian transport that same day. The PPA spokesman said there was \u201cincreased activity on the Russian side\u201d and that the safety of residents of the border villages was their priority. <br/>A few days later, on 16 October, the Estonian government <a href=\"https://news.err.ee/1609828299/government-may-waive-bureaucracy-to-speed-up-saatse-boot-bypass-minister-says\">decided</a> to prioritise a new bypass, work on which is due for completion by the spring. V\u00e4rska <br/>To the north of Lutep\u00e4\u00e4 is V\u00e4rska, the local administrative centre, a popular spa resort that attracts people from all over the Baltic states. However, the holidaymakers we attempted to speak with seemed reluctant to answer questions, and told us that they had no interest in politics. <br/>V\u00e4rska is a busy place compared to Lutep\u00e4\u00e4, and attracts residents of nearby villages who come here to shop and to access government services and healthcare. The local cultural centre hosts amateur concerts, mainly for retirees, and minibuses regularly run between the supermarket and other villages in the parish. \u201e <br/><br/>She adds that her family lives in this parish, but that if something happens, they\u2019ll all \u201cmove as far away as possible\u201d.  <br/>Now there is just one 18-year-old waiting for her mother to finish shopping. \u201cNo one\u2019s worried about Russian soldiers. The only worrying time was when they came so close,\u201d she says, stammering a little. Her middle-aged mother appears, carrying two small bags. She is much more concerned than her daughter about Russian soldiers in the border area.  <br/>\u201cI support closing the boot,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking for a long time there should come a point when we do something. No Estonian will pass through it now. It\u2019s dangerous. You never know what the other side will decide.\u201d <br/>She adds that her family lives in this parish, but that if something happens, they\u2019ll all \u201cmove as far away as possible\u201d. <br/>They get on the bus and leave, their journey home unaffected by the closure of the boot. The driver of another bus who overheard our conversation smiles. \u201cI\u2019ve been driving this bus for six months and nothing has happened. I wasn\u2019t afraid before either. I ferry people from one place to another. Why should I worry?\u201d <br/>There aren\u2019t many people on the streets of V\u00e4rska so we knock on doors. Often only guard dogs bark back at us. At one house, a woman of over 50 in rubber boots and garden gloves opens up after a couple of minutes. <br/>\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d she asks. Then says: \u201cI\u2019ll get my husband. He speaks Russian.\u201d Her husband is a smiling pensioner with his beanie down over one ear. He speaks fluent Russian, a rarity in this area, and plays down the threat from across the border, as well as the seriousness of the recent incident. <br/>The Russians have enough problems of their own and aren\u2019t interested in Estonia, he argues. \u201cPeople are starving, they have no money, and yet they\u2019ll mount an attack? It makes no sense. If they were strong, like NATO, then OK \u2026 But everything\u2019s bad there. They haven\u2019t got anything to eat. Will a hungry man attack? It\u2019s laughable.\u201d <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/7839b2216ce84b22b3052df102999e16.jpeg\"/><figcaption>A villager in V\u00e4rska, Estonia. Photo: Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>Next we meet a pensioner with a stick on his way home from a walk. Having heard us speak, he switches to Russian and says in a strong accent: \u201cLet them attack. There\u2019s nothing for them here,\u201d with a laugh before going on his way. <br/>Taarka Tar\u00f5 K\u00f6\u00f6gik\u00f5n\u00f5 is a restaurant in the village of Obinitsa that serves the cuisine of the Seto people, an indigenous Finnic people and linguistic minority that have historically lived in the borderlands between modern day Estonia and Russia. <br/>The restaurant\u2019s owner, Rieka H\u00f5rn, tells me that the Saatse boot is historically Seto land, adding that \u201ctwo thirds of our land was taken from us.\u201d Her view of the Russian soldiers\u2019 recent appearance there is ambivalent. \u201cThe servicemen were on their own territory and didn\u2019t violate any laws.\u201d <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/d2b11da78ac549ef947cd72a127f72d2.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Women wear Seto traditional dresses as they attend the Seto Dance Festival in V\u00e4rska, Estonia, 29 June 2024. Photo: EPA / Valda Kalnina.</figcaption><br/>The Seto are a small minority numbering about 13,000 living in southeast Estonia. After Estonia was absorbed by the USSR in 1945, the Soviet authorities transferred most of the Seto to the nearby Pskov region of Russia. However, some Seto moved to Estonia, where they were increasingly assimilated, whereas those who stayed in the Pskov region were forcibly russified. However, despite the new boundaries between them, Setos remained in touch right up until the collapse of the USSR. <br/>The Seto continue to hold territorial claims against Russia, having lost their capital, Petseri, now renamed Pechory, and over half their land to the country. Some Seto have family homes and the graves of family members in the Pskov region, and while it used to be possible for them to visit before the war in Ukraine began, since then, the borders have been closed, Russian visas became far harder to obtain and preferential treatment for people from the border region was abandoned. Some 100 or so Seto still live in Russia, and those on the Estonian side consider losing contact with them as a tragedy. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/c25645dd27be407a99f8610c5af7a548.jpeg\"/><figcaption>Rieka H\u00f5rn at her restaurant in Obinitsa, Estonia. Photo: Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>Saabolda <br/>In the village of Saabolda, south of the Saatse boot, people are more talkative. Viktor and Marek, both in their forties, are on their way to the mobile grocery van. One is in waders, the other in a waterproof jacket and trousers, both wear rubber boots. They eye us a little suspiciously, but smile when we approach. <br/>The boot\u2019s closure has changed nothing for them. \u201cLife got a kilometre longer,\u201d Viktor says. \u201cActually, it\u2019s got safer, as there are patrols everywhere.\u201d <br/>\u201cWhat does Russia want with us?\u201d Marek chips in. \u201cIf they need Estonia, they\u2019ll attack Tallinn. We\u2019re small. We\u2019re not of interest. But if they want to, they\u2019ll go wherever.\u201d <br/>Viktor shakes his head thoughtfully. \u201cWhere can we go if nowhere\u2019s safe? I can\u2019t buy a house in Spain like some rich person! We\u2019ve got to believe in the army.\u201d <br/>\u201cI don\u2019t think our army will protect us,\u201d Marek interjects. They\u2019d try, but whether it would come to anything is another matter.\u201d \u201e <br/><br/>A man in shabby dark clothes sits at the bus stop on the way out of Saabolda. He complains about Estonian politicians, the road and the bus.  <br/>The two friends do agree on one thing, though \u2014 the media is largely responsible for stirring up fear and panic. \u201cThe media constantly writes about a possible war,\u201d Viktor says with a laugh. \u201cIf they stopped, people wouldn\u2019t be scared. The less news you read, the better.\u201d <br/>A man in shabby dark clothes sits at the bus stop on the way out of Saabolda. He complains about Estonian politicians, the road and the bus. <br/>\u201cWhat use are these idiot politicians? The fucking morons closed the road. Life is worse now. There\u2019s no bus because of the boot. They can sail there in a submarine for all I care. It\u2019s their territory,\u201d he says of the Russian servicemen. <br/>Like Marek and Viktor, he too is in a hurry to get to the \u201cshop on wheels\u201d, which serves the larger villages in the parish every Friday. If he misses it, he\u2019ll have to wait another week as there are no other shops in Saabolda. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/10acca472d8a46a8a1ace9872a7c86ad.jpeg\"/><figcaption>The driver of the mobile supermarket serves customers in the village of Saabolda, Estonia. Photo: Novaya Gazeta Europe.</figcaption><br/>The van\u2019s driver is a friendly blonde woman in her thirties who\u2019s been doing the job for a little over a year. The shop on wheels has shelves of cookies, juices, alcoholic drinks and sodas, as well as two refrigerators with fresh fish. It also sells bread and dairy products. She wears gloves as she puts small fish in a bag for a pensioner in a grey jacket. The woman asks her to weigh out some cookies and sweets too. Next comes a man of about 40. He is unshaven and wrinkled and his red hands tremble slightly. He takes his vodka and leaves. <br/>The saleswoman says the job has got harder. \u201cPeople miss us and end up with no food,\u201d she says sadly. \u201cWe were half an hour late today, but, thank God, people waited.\u201d <br/>She says the appearance of the Russian military in the boot didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cNothing terrible happened. My friends think they were just doing their job. \u2026 I\u2019m not particularly scared they\u2019ll attack.\u201d",

Photo: Vologodskoy Kanvoy / Telegram.</figcaption><br/>Residents of the northwestern Russian city of Vologda awoke on Monday to discover that a 9-metre-tall monument to Ivan the Terrible had been installed on its central square overnight, <a href=\"https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8179299\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to state-affiliated Russian daily newspaper Kommersant. <br/>The square, which is closed for renovations, is scheduled to reopen on Tuesday to coincide with National Unity Day, a public holiday in Russia that celebrates the expulsion of Polish forces from Moscow at the end of the so-called Time of Troubles in the 17th century.  <br/>Tsar Ivan IV, better known in the West as Ivan the Terrible, ruled Russia from 1533 until his death in 1584, and is chiefly remembered today for his expansion of Russian lands into Siberia, as well as for his extreme cruelty and his brutal repression of the boyars, or noblemen, whom he saw as a threat to his power.  <br/>The driving force behind the new monument was regional Governor Georgy Filimonov, an ultra-nationalist politician who has <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/11/03/v-tsentre-vologdy-ustanovili-pamiatnik-ivanu-groznomu-news\" target=\"_blank\">described</a> Ivan the Terrible as a \u201cmultiplier of Russian lands,\u201d a \u201csymbol of the Russian world,\u201d and a \u201cconquering tsar in a good sense\u201d.  <br/>Filliminov has <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/03/21/fathoming-filimonov-en\" target=\"_blank\">gained</a> notoriety for his Mao suits and his outspoken praise for Soviet dictators Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, and raised eyebrows in December when he <a href=\"https://t.me/filimonov_official/14023\" target=\"_blank\">unveiled</a> a statue to the latter in Vologda while urging those present to \u201ccherish\u201d Stalin\u2019s memory. <br/>Recent interest in rehabilitating discredited Russian historical figures has not been limited to Vologda, however, with the honouring of brutal autocrats and dictators now a nationwide phenomenon, one perhaps most notably demonstrated when a wall sculpture depicting Stalin that had been destroyed in the 1960s was restored to a Moscow metro station in May.",

Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian officials and their colleagues in the Kremlin-controlled media have taken to referring to their Western adversaries as \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov even stated that the \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d in question are <a href=\"https://tass.ru/politika/22307123\" target=\"_blank\">bent</a> on defeating Russia \u201cwith the hands of the Kyiv regime.\u201d <br/>Indeed, analysis one of us conducted with Adrian Rogstad at the University of Groningen looking at statements posted on the Russian Foreign Ministry website found a marked increase in \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d references after the invasion of Ukraine \u2014 86 of them in the course of 2022, compared to just 27 in the previous 20 years.  \u201e <br/><br/>The United States is referred to as \u201cthe main inspirer, organiser and executor of the aggressive anti-Russian policy of the collective West\u201d.  <br/>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\u2019s March 2022 comment that the \u201cAnglo-Saxon world will never stop \u2026 It\u2019s like an insatiable monster,\u201d is <a href=\"https://mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/1800451/\" target=\"_blank\">typical</a> of the way \u201cAnglo-Saxon\u201d is used. The term even made it into the official Russian foreign policy concept published a year later, where in the section titled \u201cThe US and other Anglo-Saxon states,\u201d the United States is referred to as \u201cthe main inspirer, organiser and executor of the aggressive anti-Russian policy of the collective West\u201d. <br/>The term is a particular favourite of Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. In February 2024, Peskov <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/news/2024/02/07/kremlin-says-putin-agreed-to-interview-with-tucker-carlson-because-he-differs-from-traditional-anglo-saxon-media\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> that Putin agreed to be <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/02/09/journalism-in-name-only-en\" target=\"_blank\">interviewed</a> by the right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson because he \u201cstands in clear contrast to the position of the traditional Anglo-Saxon media\u201d. <img src=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/static/records/578047927db3416999eeee7e4a24d3b2.jpeg\"/><figcaption>The Sutton Hoo helmet on display at the British Museum in London, 25 March 2014.

Former US <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/06/27/us-ambassador-to-russia-signs-off-posting-with-pushkin-quote-en-news\" target=\"_blank\">ambassador</a> to Moscow Lynne Tracy said in 2023 that the use of the term was \u201cvery strange\u201d given the multiethnic character of American society. <br/>Reports suggest that with the election of a more Russia-friendly president in Donald Trump, the word from the Kremlin was not to use the term for Americans, specifically. But it appears not everyone got the memo \u2014 pro-Putin State Duma Deputy Viktor Vodolatsky recently <a href=\"https://arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=93911lang=3\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> against \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d creating a \u201cpoint of tension\u201d in the South Caucasus through the US-led peace efforts between Azerbaijan and Armenia. <br/>As experts in Russian discourse and post-Soviet nations, we see the increased use of \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d as reflecting deeper trends that tap into Putin\u2019s use of history to justify the invasion of Ukraine and smear his perceived enemies, while exploiting political divisions in Europe and America. \u201e <br/><br/>It wasn\u2019t until the 16th century that scholars started to refer to the Anglo-Saxon origins of the English, in a bid to differentiate the country from Catholic Europe.  <br/>The original Anglo-Saxons comprised the waves of conquerors from Germanic tribes in Europe that flooded into England \u2014 Jutes as well as Angles and Saxons \u2014 in the fifth and sixth centuries. Alfred the Great united the warring fiefdoms of southern England in the ninth century and declared himself king of the Anglo-Saxon realm. But the term did not enter wider usage until long after the \u201cAnglo-Saxon period\u201d ended with the invasion of England by French-speaking Normans in 1066. <br/>In fact, it wasn\u2019t until the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century that scholars started to refer to the Anglo-Saxon origins of the English, in a bid to differentiate the country from Catholic Europe \u2014 another use of history for political aims. <br/>But the term really took off in the 19th century, when it was folded into pseudoscientific racist justification for the British Empire. That came to an end in World War I, when Britain and America found themselves fighting against Germany \u2014 the location of Saxony. In 1917, the British royal family changed their name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. Even US President Woodrow Wilson \u2014 an acknowledged racist \u2014 insisted that Americans were <a href=\"https://greatwarproject.org/2018/12/24/the-great-questions-emerge-who-won-the-war/\" target=\"_blank\">not</a> Anglo-Saxons. <br/>There things stood until 1964, when American professor E. Digby Baltzell <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/20/us/e-digby-baltzell-dies-at-80-studied-wasp-s.html\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> The Protestant Establishment, which popularised the term \u201cWhite Anglo Saxon Protestant\u201d, or WASP, to refer to middle-class Americans of European descent. \u201e <br/><br/>It is against this background of Anglo-Saxon as a term appropriated by white supremacists that modern Russian usage should be seen.  <br/>By the 2000s, it was mostly white supremacists who were using the term Anglo-Saxon as a synonym for a modern-day demographic. Academic <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/27596\" target=\"_blank\">journals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/09/19/its-all-white-people-allegations-white-supremacy-are-tearing-apart-prestigious-medieval-studies-group/\" target=\"_blank\">groups</a> dedicated to studying the Middle Ages dropped references to \u201cAnglo-Saxons\u201d due to the racist connotations. <br/>It is against this background of Anglo-Saxon as a term appropriated by white supremacists that modern Russian usage should be seen. Russian propaganda has long sought to talk up the far right in Europe and America, with whom Putin\u2019s \u201cnational conservatism\u201d has a<a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/politics/ideology-and-meaning-making-under-putin-regime\" target=\"_blank\"> close</a> affinity.
